       "\"THE ADVENTURE OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS CLIENT It can't hurt now, was Mr. Sherlock Holmes's comment when, for the tenth time in as many years, I asked his leave to reveal the following narrative. So it was that at last I obtained permission to put on record what was, in some ways, the supreme moment of my friend's career. Both Holmes and I had a weakness for the Turkish Bath. It was over a smoke in the pleasant lassitude of the drying-room that I have found him less reticent and more human than anywhere else. On the upper floor of the Northumberland Avenue establishment there is an isolated corner where two couches lie side by side, and it was on these that we lay upon September 3, 1902, the day when my narrative begins. I had asked him whether anything was stirring, and for answer he had shot his long, thin, nervous arm out of the sheets which enveloped him and had drawn an envelope from the inside pocket of the coat which hung beside him. It may be some fussy, self-important fool, it may be a matter of life or death, said he, as he handed me the note. I know no more than this message tells me. It was from the Carlton Club, and dated the evening before. This is what I read: Sir James Damery presents his compliments to Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and will call upon him at 4.30 to-morrow. Sir James begs to say that the matter upon which he desires to consult Mr. Holmes is very delicate, and also very important. He trusts, therefore, that Mr. Holmes will make every effort to grant this interview, and that he will confirm it over the telephone to the Carlton Club. I need not say that I have confirmed it, Watson, said Holmes, as I returned the paper. Do you know anything of this man Damery? Only that his name is a household word in Society. Well, I can tell you a little more than that. He has rather a reputation for arranging delicate matters which are to be kept out of the papers. You may remember his negotiations with Sir George Lewis over the Hammerford Will case. He is a man of the world with a natural turn for diplomacy. I am bound, therefore, to hope that it is not a false scent and that he has some real need for our assistance. Our? Well, if you will be so good, Watson. I shall be honoured. Then you have the hour--four-thirty. Until then we can put the matter out of our heads. I was living in my own rooms in Queen Anne Street at the time, but I was round at Baker Street before the time named. Sharp to the half-hour, Colonel Sir James Damery was announced. It is hardly necessary to describe him, for many will remember that large, bluff, honest personality, that broad, clean-shaven face, above all, that pleasant, mellow voice. Frankness shone from his grey Irish eyes, and good humour played round his mobile, smiling lips. His lucent top-hat, his dark frock-coat, indeed, every detail, from the pearl pin in the black satin cravat to the lavender spats over the varnished shoes, spoke of the meticulous care in dress for which he was famous. The big, masterful aristocrat dominated the little room. Of course, I was prepared to find Dr. Watson, he remarked, with a courteous bow. His collaboration may be very necessary, for we are dealing on this occasion, Mr. Holmes, with a man to whom violence is familiar and who will, literally, stick at nothing. I should say that there is no more dangerous man in Europe. I have had several opponents to whom that flattering term has been applied, said Holmes, with a smile. Don't you smoke? Then you will excuse me if I light my pipe. If your man is more dangerous than the late Professor Moriarty, or than the living Colonel Sebastian Moran, then he is indeed worth meeting. May I ask his name? Have you ever heard of Baron Gruner? You mean the Austrian murderer? Colonel Damery threw up his kid-gloved hands with a laugh. There is no getting past you, Mr. Holmes! Wonderful! So you have already sized him up as a murderer? It is my business to follow the details of Continental crime. Who could possibly have read what happened at Prague and have any doubts as to the man's guilt! It was a purely technical legal point and the suspicious death of a witness that saved him! I am as sure that he killed his wife when the so-called 'accident' happened in the Splügen Pass as if I had seen him do it. I knew, also, that he had come to England, and had a presentiment that sooner or later he would find me some work to do. Well, what has Baron Gruner been up to? I presume it is not this old tragedy which has come up again? No, it is more serious than that. To revenge crime is important, but to prevent it is more so. It is a terrible thing, Mr. Holmes, to see a dreadful event, an atrocious situation, preparing itself before your eyes, to clearly understand whither it will lead and yet to be utterly unable to avert it. Can a human being be placed in a more trying position? Perhaps not. Then you will sympathize with the client in whose interests I am acting. I did not understand that you were merely an intermediary. Who is the principal? Mr. Holmes, I must beg you not to press that question. It is important that I should be able to assure him that his honoured name has been in no way dragged into the matter. His motives are, to the last degree, honourable and chivalrous, but he prefers to remain unknown. I need not say that your fees will be assured and that you will be given a perfectly free hand. Surely the actual name of your client is immaterial? I am sorry, said Holmes. I am accustomed to have mystery at one end of my cases, but to have it at both ends is too confusing. I fear, Sir James, that I must decline to act. Our visitor was greatly disturbed. His large, sensitive face was darkened with emotion and disappointment. You hardly realize the effect of your own action, Mr. Holmes, said he. You place me in a most serious dilemma, for I am perfectly certain that you would be proud to take over the case if I could give you the facts, and yet a promise forbids me from revealing them all. May I, at least, lay all that I can before you? By all means, so long as it is understood that I commit myself to nothing. That is understood. In the first place, you have no doubt heard of General de Merville? De Merville of Khyber fame? Yes, I have heard of him. He has a daughter, Violet de Merville, young, rich, beautiful, accomplished, a wonder-woman in every way. It is this daughter, this lovely, innocent girl, whom we are endeavouring to save from the clutches of a fiend. Baron Gruner has some hold over her, then? The strongest of all holds where a woman is concerned--the hold of love. The fellow is, as you may have heard, extraordinarily handsome, with a most fascinating manner, a gentle voice, and that air of romance and mystery which means so much to a woman. He is said to have the whole sex at his mercy and to have made ample use of the fact. But how came such a man to meet a lady of the standing of Miss Violet de Merville? It was on a Mediterranean yachting voyage. The company, though select, paid their own passages. No doubt the promoters hardly realized the Baron's true character until it was too late. The villain attached himself to the lady, and with such effect that he has completely and absolutely won her heart. To say that she loves him hardly expresses it. She dotes upon him, she is obsessed by him. Outside of him there is nothing on earth. She will not hear one word against him. Everything has been done to cure her of her madness, but in vain. To sum up, she proposes to marry him next month. As she is of age and has a will of iron, it is hard to know how to prevent her. Does she know about the Austrian episode? The cunning devil has told her every unsavoury public scandal of his past life, but always in such a way as to make himself out to be an innocent martyr. She absolutely accepts his version and will listen to no other. Dear me! But surely you have inadvertently let out the name of your client? It is no doubt General de Merville. Our visitor fidgeted in his chair. I could deceive you by saying so, Mr. Holmes, but it would not be true. De Merville is a broken man. The strong soldier has been utterly demoralized by this incident. He has lost the nerve which never failed him on the battlefield and has become a weak, doddering old man, utterly incapable of contending with a brilliant, forceful rascal like this Austrian. My client, however, is an old friend, one who has known the General intimately for many years and taken a paternal interest in this young girl since she wore short frocks. He cannot see this tragedy consummated without some attempt to stop it. There is nothing in which Scotland Yard can act. It was his own suggestion that you should be called in, but it was, as I have said, on the express stipulation that he should not be personally involved in the matter. I have no doubt, Mr. Holmes, with your great powers you could easily trace my client back through me, but I must ask you, as a point of honour, to refrain from doing so, and not to break in upon his incognito. Holmes gave a whimsical smile. I think I may safely promise that, said he. I may add that your problem interests me, and that I shall be prepared to look into it. How shall I keep in touch with you? The Carlton Club will find me. But, in case of emergency, there is a private telephone call, 'XX.31.' Holmes noted it down and sat, still smiling, with the open memorandum-book upon his knee. The Baron's present address, please? Vernon Lodge, near Kingston. It is a large house. He has been fortunate in some rather shady speculations and is a rich man, which, naturally, makes him a more dangerous antagonist. Is he at home at present? Yes. Apart from what you have told me, can you give me any further information about the man? He has expensive tastes. He is a horse fancier. For a short time he played polo at Hurlingham, but then this Prague affair got noised about and he had to leave. He collects books and pictures. He is a man with a considerable artistic side to his nature. He is, I believe, a recognized authority upon Chinese pottery, and has written a book upon the subject. A complex mind, said Holmes. All great criminals have that. My old friend Charlie Peace was a violin virtuoso. Wainwright was no mean artist. I could quote many more. Well, Sir James, you will inform your client that I am turning my mind upon Baron Gruner. I can say no more. I have some sources of information of my own, and dare say we may find some means of opening matter up. When our visitor had left us, Holmes sat so long in deep thought that it seemed to me that he had forgotten my presence. At last, however, he came briskly back to earth. Well, Watson, any views? he asked. I should think you had better see the young lady herself. My dear Watson, if her poor old broken father cannot move her, how shall I, a stranger, prevail? And yet there is something in the suggestion if all else fails. But I think we must begin from a different angle. I rather fancy that Shinwell Johnson might be a help. I have not had occasion to mention Shinwell Johnson in these memoirs because I have seldom drawn my cases from the latter phases of my friend's career. During the first years of the century he became a valuable assistant. Johnson, I grieve to say, made his name first as a very dangerous villain and served two terms at Parkhurst. Finally, he repented and allied himself to Holmes, acting as his agent in the huge criminal underworld of London, and obtaining information which often proved to be of vital importance. Had Johnson been a nark of the police he would soon have been exposed, but as he dealt with cases which never came directly into the courts, his activities were never realized by his companions. With the glamour of his two convictions upon him, he had the _entrée_ of every night-club, doss-house, and gambling-den in the town, and his quick observation and active brain made him an ideal agent for gaining information. It was to him that Sherlock Holmes now proposed to turn. It was not possible for me to follow the immediate steps taken by my friend, for I had some pressing professional business of my own, but I met him by appointment that evening at Simpson's, where, sitting at a small table in the front window, and looking down at the rushing stream of life in the Strand, he told me something of what had passed. Johnson is on the prowl, said he. He may pick up some garbage in the darker recesses of the underworld, for it is down there, amid the black roots of crime, that we must hunt for this man's secrets. But, if the lady will not accept what is already known, why should any fresh discovery of yours turn her from her purpose? Who knows, Watson? Woman's heart and mind are insoluble puzzles to the male. Murder might be condoned or explained, and yet some smaller offence might rankle. Baron Gruner remarked to me---- He remarked to you! Oh, to be sure, I had not told you of my plans! Well, Watson, I love to come to close grips with my man. I like to meet him eye to eye and read for myself the stuff that he is made of. When I had given Johnson his instructions, I took a cab out to Kingston and found the Baron in a most affable mood. Did he recognize you? There was no difficulty about that, for I simply sent in my card. He is an excellent antagonist, cool as ice, silky voiced and soothing as one of your fashionable consultants, and poisonous as a cobra. He has breed in him, a real aristocrat of crime, with a superficial suggestion of afternoon tea and all the cruelty of the grave behind it. Yes, I am glad to have had my attention called to Baron Adelbert Gruner. You say he was affable? A purring cat who thinks he sees prospective mice. Some people's affability is more deadly than the violence of coarser souls. His greeting was characteristic. 'I rather thought I should see you sooner or later, Mr. Holmes,' said he. 'You have been engaged, no doubt, by General de Merville to endeavour to stop my marriage with his daughter, Violet. That is so, is it not?' I acquiesced. 'My dear man,' said he, 'you will only ruin your own well-deserved reputation. It is not a case in which you can possibly succeed. You will have barren work, to say nothing of incurring some danger. Let me very strongly advise you to draw off at once.' 'It is curious,' I answered, 'but that was the very advice which I had intended to give you. I have a respect for your brains, Baron, and the little which I have seen of your personality has not lessened it. Let me put it to you as man to man. No one wants to rake up your past and make you unduly uncomfortable. It is over, and you are now in smooth waters, but if you persist in this marriage you will raise up a swarm of powerful enemies who will never leave you alone until they have made England too hot to hold you. Is the game worth it? Surely you would be wiser if you left the lady alone. It would not be pleasant for you if these facts of your past were brought to her notice.' The Baron has little waxed tips of hair under his nose, like the short antennae of an insect. These quivered with amusement as he listened, and he finally broke into a gentle chuckle. 'Excuse my amusement, Mr. Holmes,' said he, 'but it is really funny to see you trying to play a hand with no cards in it. I don't think anyone could do it better, but it is rather pathetic, all the same. Not a colour card there, Mr. Holmes, nothing but the smallest of the small.' 'So you think.' 'So I know. Let me make the thing clear to you, for my own hand is so strong that I can afford to show it. I have been fortunate enough to win the entire affection of this lady. This was given to me in spite of the fact that I told her very clearly of all the unhappy incidents in my past life. I also told her that certain wicked and designing persons--I hope you recognize yourself--would come to her and tell her these things, and I warned her how to treat them. You have heard of post-hypnotic suggestion, Mr. Holmes? Well, you will see how it works, for a man of personality can use hypnotism without any vulgar passes or tomfoolery. So she is ready for you and, I have no doubt, would give you an appointment, for she is quite amenable to her father's will--save only in the one little matter.' Well, Watson, there seemed to be no more to say, so I took my leave with as much cold dignity as I could summon, but, as I had my hand on the door-handle, he stopped me. 'By the way, Mr. Holmes,' said he, 'did you know Le Brun, the French agent?' 'Yes,' said I. 'Do you know what befell him?' 'I heard that he was beaten by some Apaches in the Montmartre district and crippled for life.' 'Quite true, Mr. Holmes. By a curious coincidence he had been inquiring into my affairs only a week before. Don't do it, Mr. Holmes; it's not a lucky thing to do. Several have found that out. My last word to you is, go your own way and let me go mine. Good-bye!' So there you are, Watson. You are up to date now. The fellow seems dangerous. Mighty dangerous. I disregard the blusterer, but this is the sort of man who says rather less than he means. Must you interfere? Does it really matter if he marries the girl? Considering that he undoubtedly murdered his last wife, I should say it mattered very much. Besides, the client! Well, well, we need not discuss that. When you have finished your coffee you had best come home with me, for the blithe Shinwell will be there with his report. We found him sure enough, a huge, coarse, red-faced, scorbutic man, with a pair of vivid black eyes which were the only external sign of the very cunning mind within. It seems that he had dived down into what was peculiarly his kingdom, and beside him on the settee was a brand which he had brought up in the shape of a slim, flame-like young woman with a pale, intense face, youthful, and yet so worn with sin and sorrow that one read the terrible years which had left their leprous mark upon her. This is Miss Kitty Winter, said Shinwell Johnson, waving his fat hand as an introduction. What she don't know--well, there, she'll speak for herself. Put my hand right on her, Mr. Holmes, within an hour of your message. I'm easy to find, said the young woman. Hell, London, gets me every time. Same address for Porky Shinwell. We're old mates, Porky, you and I. But, by Gripes! there is another who ought to be down in a lower hell than we if there was any justice in the world! That is the man you are after, Mr. Holmes. Holmes smiled. I gather we have your good wishes, Miss Winter. If I can help to put him where he belongs, I'm yours to the rattle, said our visitor, with fierce energy. There was an intensity of hatred in her white, set face and her blazing eyes such as woman seldom and man never can attain. You needn't go into my past, Mr. Holmes. That's neither here nor there. But what I am Adelbert Gruner made me. If I could pull him down! She clutched frantically with her hands into the air. Oh, if I could only pull him into the pit where he has pushed so many! You know how the matter stands? Porky Shinwell has been telling me. He's after some other poor fool and wants to marry her this time. You want to stop it. Well, you surely know enough about this devil to prevent any decent girl in her senses wanting to be in the same parish with him. She is not in her senses. She is madly in love. She has been told all about him. She cares nothing. Told about the murder? Yes. My Lord, she must have a nerve! She puts them all down as slanders. Couldn't you lay proofs before her silly eyes? Well, can you help us do so? Ain't I a proof myself? If I stood before her and told her how he used me---- Would you do this? Would I? Would I not! Well, it might be worth trying. But he has told her most of his sins and had pardon from her, and I understand she will not reopen the question. I'll lay he didn't tell her all, said Miss Winter. I caught a glimpse of one or two murders besides the one that made such a fuss. He would speak of someone in his velvet way and then look at me with a steady eye and say: 'He died within a month.' It wasn't hot air, either. But I took little notice--you see, I loved him myself at that time. Whatever he did went with me, same as with this poor fool! There was just one thing that shook me. Yes, by Gripes! if it had not been for his poisonous, lying tongue that explains and soothes, I'd have left him that very night. It's a book he has--a brown leather book with a lock, and his arms in gold on the outside. I think he was a bit drunk that night, or he would not have shown it to me. What was it, then? I tell you, Mr. Holmes, this man collects women, and takes a pride in his collection, as some men collect moths or butterflies. He had it all in that book. Snapshot photographs, names, details, everything about them. It was a beastly book--a book no man, even if he had come from the gutter, could have put together. But it was Adelbert Gruner's book all the same. 'Souls I have ruined.' He could have put that on the outside if he had been so minded. However, that's neither here nor there, for the book would not serve you, and, if it would, you can't get it. Where is it? How can I tell you where it is now? It's more than a year since I left him. I know where he kept it then. He's a precise, tidy cat of a man in many of his ways, so maybe it is still in the pigeon-hole of the old bureau in the inner study. Do you know his house? I've been in the study, said Holmes. Have you, though? You haven't been slow on the job if you only started this morning. Maybe dear Adelbert has met his match this time. The outer study is the one with the Chinese crockery in it--big glass cupboard between the windows. Then behind his desk is the door that leads to the inner study--a small room where he keeps papers and things. Is he not afraid of burglars? Adelbert is no coward. His worst enemy couldn't say that of him. He can look after himself. There's a burglar alarm at night. Besides, what is there for a burglar--unless they got away with all this fancy crockery? No good, said Shinwell Johnson, with the decided voice of the expert. No fence wants stuff of that sort that you can neither melt nor sell. Quite so, said Holmes. Well, now, Miss Winter, if you would call here to-morrow evening at five, I would consider in the meanwhile whether your suggestion of seeing this lady personally may not be arranged. I am exceedingly obliged to you for your co-operation. I need not say that my clients will consider liberally---- None of that, Mr. Holmes, cried the young woman. I am not out for money. Let me see this man in the mud, and I've got all I worked for--in the mud with my foot on his cursed face. That's my price. I'm with you to-morrow or any other day so long as you are on his track. Porky here can tell you always where to find me. I did not see Holmes again until the following evening, when we dined once more at our Strand restaurant. He shrugged his shoulders when I asked him what luck he had had in his interview. Then he told the story, which I would repeat in this way. His hard, dry statement needs some little editing to soften it into the terms of real life. There was no difficulty at all about the appointment, said Holmes, for the girl glories in showing abject filial obedience in all secondary things in an attempt to atone for her flagrant breach of it in her engagement. The General 'phoned that all was ready, and the fiery Miss W. turned up according to schedule, so that at half-past five a cab deposited us outside 104 Berkeley Square, where the old soldier resides--one of those awful grey London castles which would make a church seem frivolous. A footman showed us into a great yellow-curtained drawing-room, and there was the lady awaiting us, demure, pale, self-contained, as inflexible and remote as a snow image on a mountain. I don't quite know how to make her clear to you, Watson. Perhaps you may meet her before we are through, and you can use your own gift of words. She is beautiful, but with the ethereal other-world beauty of some fanatic whose thoughts are set on high. I have seen such faces in the pictures of the old masters of the Middle Ages. How a beast-man could have laid his vile paws upon such a being of the beyond I cannot imagine. You may have noticed how extremes call to each other, the spiritual to the animal, the cave-man to the angel. You never saw a worse case than this. She knew what we had come for, of course--that villain had lost no time in poisoning her mind against us. Miss Winter's advent rather amazed her, I think, but she waved us into our respective chairs like a Reverend Abbess receiving two rather leprous mendicants. If your head is inclined to swell, my dear Watson, take a course of Miss Violet de Merville. 'Well, sir,' said she, in a voice like the wind from an iceberg, 'your name is familiar to me. You have called, as I understand, to malign my fiancé, Baron Gruner. It is only by my father's request that I see you at all, and I warn you in advance that anything you can say could not possibly have the slightest effect upon my mind.' I was sorry for her, Watson. I thought of her for the moment as I would have thought of a daughter of my own. I am not often eloquent. I use my head, not my heart. But I really did plead with her with all the warmth of words that I could find in my nature. I pictured to her the awful position of the woman who only wakes to a man's character after she is his wife--a woman who has to submit to be caressed by bloody hands and lecherous lips. I spared her nothing--the shame, the fear, the agony, the hopelessness of it all. All my hot words could not bring one tinge of colour to those ivory cheeks or one gleam of emotion to those abstracted eyes. I thought of what the rascal had said about a post-hypnotic influence. One could really believe that she was living above the earth in some ecstatic dream. Yet there was nothing indefinite in her replies. 'I have listened to you with patience, Mr. Holmes,' said she. 'The effect upon my mind is exactly as predicted. I am aware that Adelbert, that my fiancé, has had a stormy life in which he has incurred bitter hatreds and most unjust aspersions. You are only the last of a series who have brought their slanders before me. Possibly you mean well, though I learn that you are a paid agent who would have been equally willing to act for the Baron as against him. But in any case I wish you to understand once for all that I love him and that he loves me, and that the opinion of all the world is no more to me than the twitter of those birds outside the window. If his noble nature has ever for an instant fallen, it may be that I have been specially sent to raise it to its true and lofty level. I am not clear,' here she turned her eyes upon my companion, 'who this young lady may be.' I was about to answer when the girl broke in like a whirlwind. If ever you saw flame and ice face to face, it was those two women. 'I'll tell you who I am,' she cried, springing out of her chair, her mouth all twisted with passion--'I am his last mistress. I am one of a hundred that he has tempted and used and ruined and thrown into the refuse heap, as he will you also. _Your_ refuse heap is more likely to be a grave, and maybe that's the best. I tell you, you foolish woman, if you marry this man he'll be the death of you. It may be a broken heart or it may be a broken neck, but he'll have you one way or the other. It's not out of love for you I'm speaking. I don't care a tinker's curse whether you live or die. It's out of hate for him and to spite him and to get back on him for what he did to me. But it's all the same, and you needn't look at me like that, my fine lady, for you may be lower than I am before you are through with it.' 'I should prefer not to discuss such matters,' said Miss de Merville coldly. 'Let me say once for all that I am aware of three passages in my fiancé's life in which he became entangled with designing women, and that I am assured of his hearty repentance for any evil that he may have done.' 'Three passages!' screamed my companion. 'You fool! You unutterable fool!' 'Mr. Holmes, I beg that you will bring this interview to an end,' said the icy voice. 'I have obeyed my father's wish in seeing you, but I am not compelled to listen to the ravings of this person.' With an oath Miss Winter darted forward, and if I had not caught her wrist she would have clutched this maddening woman by the hair. I dragged her towards the door, and was lucky to get her back into the cab without a public scene, for she was beside herself with rage. In a cold way I felt pretty furious myself, Watson, for there was something indescribably annoying in the calm aloofness and supreme self-complaisance of the woman whom we were trying to save. So now once again you know exactly how we stand, and it is clear that I must plan some fresh opening move, for this gambit won't work. I'll keep in touch with you, Watson, for it is more than likely that you will have your part to play, though it is just possible that the next move may lie with them rather than with us. And it did. Their blow fell--or his blow rather, for never could I believe that the lady was privy to it. I think I could show you the very paving-stone upon which I stood when my eyes fell upon the placard, and a pang of horror passed through my very soul. It was between the Grand Hotel and Charing Cross Station, where a one-legged news-vendor displayed his evening papers. The date was just two days after the last conversation. There, black upon yellow, was the terrible news-sheet: +-------------+ | MURDEROUS | | ATTACK | | UPON | | SHERLOCK | | HOLMES. | +-------------+ I think I stood stunned for some moments. Then I have a confused recollection of snatching at a paper, of the remonstrance of the man, whom I had not paid, and, finally, of standing in the doorway of a chemist's shop while I turned up the fateful paragraph. This was how it ran: We learn with regret that Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the well-known private detective, was the victim this morning of a murderous assault which has left him in a precarious position. There are no exact details to hand, but the event seems to have occurred about twelve o'clock in Regent Street, outside the Café Royal. The attack was made by two men armed with sticks, and Mr. Holmes was beaten about the head and body, receiving injuries which the doctors describe as most serious. He was carried to Charing Cross Hospital, and afterwards insisted upon being taken to his rooms in Baker Street. The miscreants who attacked him appear to have been respectably dressed men, who escaped from the bystanders by passing through the Café Royal and out into Glasshouse Street behind it. No doubt they belonged to that criminal fraternity which has so often had occasion to bewail the activity and ingenuity of the injured man. I need not say that my eyes had hardly glanced over the paragraph before I had sprung into a hansom and was on my way to Baker Street. I found Sir Leslie Oakshott, the famous surgeon in the hall and his brougham waiting at the kerb. No immediate danger, was his report. Two lacerated scalp wounds and some considerable bruises. Several stitches have been necessary. Morphine has been injected and quiet is essential, but an interview of a few minutes would not be absolutely forbidden. With this permission I stole into the darkened room. The sufferer was wide awake, and I heard my name in a hoarse whisper. The blind was three-quarters down, but one ray of sunlight slanted through and struck the bandaged head of the injured man. A crimson patch had soaked through the white linen compress. I sat beside him and bent my head. All right, Watson. Don't look so scared, he muttered in a very weak voice. It's not as bad as it seems. Thank God for that! I'm a bit of a single-stick expert, as you know. I took most of them on my guard. It was the second man that was too much for me. What can I do, Holmes? Of course, it was that damned fellow who set them on. I'll go and thrash the hide off him if you give the word. Good old Watson! No, we can do nothing there unless the police lay their hands on the men. But their get-away had been well prepared. We may be sure of that. Wait a little. I have my plans. The first thing is to exaggerate my injuries. They'll come to you for news. Put it on thick, Watson. Lucky if I live the week out--concussion--delirium--what you like! You can't overdo it. But Sir Leslie Oakshott? Oh, he's all right. He shall see the worst side of me. I'll look after that. Anything else? Yes. Tell Shinwell Johnson to get that girl out of the way. Those beauties will be after her now. They know, of course, that she was with me in the case. If they dared to do me in it is not likely they will neglect her. That is urgent. Do it to-night. I'll go now. Anything more? Put my pipe on the table--and the tobacco-slipper. Right! Come in each morning and we will plan our campaign. I arranged with Johnson that evening to take Miss Winter to a quiet suburb and see that she lay low until the danger was past. For six days the public were under the impression that Holmes was at the door of death. The bulletins were very grave and there were sinister paragraphs in the papers. My continual visits assured me that it was not so bad as that. His wiry constitution and his determined will were working wonders. He was recovering fast, and I had suspicions at times that he was really finding himself faster than he pretended, even to me. There was a curious secretive streak in the man which led to many dramatic effects, but left even his closest friend guessing as to what his exact plans might be. He pushed to an extreme the axiom that the only safe plotter was he who plotted alone. I was nearer him than anyone else, and yet I was always conscious of the gap between. On the seventh day the stitches were taken out, in spite of which there was a report of erysipelas in the evening papers. The same evening papers had an announcement which I was bound, sick or well, to carry to my friend. It was simply that among the passengers on the Cunard boat _Ruritania_, starting from Liverpool on Friday, was the Baron Adelbert Gruner, who had some important financial business to settle in the States before his impending wedding to Miss Violet de Merville, only daughter of, etc., etc. Holmes listened to the news with a cold, concentrated look upon his pale face, which told me that it hit him hard. Friday! he cried. Only three clear days. I believe the rascal wants to put himself out of danger's way. But he won't, Watson! By the Lord Harry, he won't! Now, Watson, I want you to do something for me. I am here to be used, Holmes. Well, then, spend the next twenty-four hours in an intensive study of Chinese pottery. He gave no explanations and I asked for none. By long experience I had learned the wisdom of obedience. But when I had left his room I walked down Baker Street, revolving in my head how on earth I was to carry out so strange an order. Finally I drove to the London Library in St. James's Square, put the matter to my friend Lomax, the sub-librarian, and departed to my rooms with a goodly volume under my arm. It is said that the barrister who crams up a case with such care that he can examine an expert witness upon the Monday has forgotten all his forced knowledge before the Saturday. Certainly I should not like now to pose as an authority upon ceramics. And yet all that evening, and all that night with a short interval for rest, and all next morning I was sucking in knowledge and committing names to memory. There I learned of the hall-marks of the great artist-decorators, of the mystery of cyclical dates, the marks of the Hung-wu and the beauties of the Yung-lo, the writings of Tang-ying, and the glories of the primitive period of the Sung and the Yuan. I was charged with all this information when I called upon Holmes next evening. He was out of bed now, though you would not have guessed it from the published reports, and he sat with his much-bandaged head resting upon his hand in the depth of his favourite arm-chair. Why, Holmes, I said, if one believed the papers you are dying. That, said he, is the very impression which I intended to convey. And now, Watson, have you learned your lessons? At least I have tried to. Good. You could keep up an intelligent conversation on the subject? I believe I could. Then hand me that little box from the mantel-piece. He opened the lid and took out a small object most carefully wrapped in some fine Eastern silk. This he unfolded, and disclosed a delicate little saucer of the most beautiful deep-blue colour. It needs careful handling, Watson. This is the real egg-shell pottery of the Ming dynasty. No finer piece ever passed through Christie's. A complete set of this would be worth a king's ransom--in fact, it is doubtful if there is a complete set outside the Imperial palace of Peking. The sight of this would drive a real connoisseur wild. What am I to do with it? Holmes handed me a card upon which was printed: Dr. Hill Barton, 369 Half Moon Street. That is your name for the evening, Watson. You will call upon Baron Gruner. I know something of his habits, and at half-past eight he would probably be disengaged. A note will tell him in advance that you are about to call, and you will say that you are bringing him a specimen of an absolutely unique set of Ming china. You may as well be a medical man, since that is a part which you can play without duplicity. You are a collector, this set has come your way, you have heard of the Baron's interest in the subject, and you are not averse to selling at a price. What price? Well asked, Watson. You would certainly fall down badly if you did not know the value of your own wares. This saucer was got for me by Sir James, and comes, I understand, from the collection of his client. You will not exaggerate if you say that it could hardly be matched in the world. I could perhaps suggest that the set should be valued by an expert. Excellent, Watson! You scintillate to-day. Suggest Christie or Sotheby. Your delicacy prevents your putting a price for yourself. But if he won't see me? Oh, yes, he will see you. He has the collection mania in its most acute form--and especially on this subject, on which he is an acknowledged authority. Sit down, Watson, and I will dictate the letter. No answer needed. You will merely say that you are coming, and why. It was an admirable document, short, courteous, and stimulating to the curiosity of the connoisseur. A district messenger was duly dispatched with it. On the same evening, with the precious saucer in my hand and the card of Dr. Hill Barton in my pocket, I set off on my own adventure. The beautiful house and grounds indicated that Baron Gruner was, as Sir James had said, a man of considerable wealth. A long winding drive, with banks of rare shrubs on either side, opened out into a great gravelled square adorned with statues. The place had been built by a South African gold king in the days of the great boom, and the long, low house with the turrets at the corners, though an architectural nightmare, was imposing in its size and solidity. A butler who would have adorned a bench of bishops showed me in, and handed me over to a plush-clad footman, who ushered me into the Baron's presence. He was standing at the open front of a great case which stood between the windows, and which contained part of his Chinese collection. He turned as I entered with a small brown vase in his hand. Pray sit down, doctor, said he. I was looking over my own treasures and wondering whether I could really afford to add to them. This little Tang specimen, which dates from the seventh century, would probably interest you. I am sure you never saw finer workmanship or a richer glaze. Have you the Ming saucer with you of which you spoke? I carefully unpacked it and handed it to him. He seated himself at his desk, pulled over the lamp, for it was growing dark, and set himself to examine it. As he did so the yellow light beat upon his own features, and I was able to study them at my ease. He was certainly a remarkably handsome man. His European reputation for beauty was fully deserved. In figure he was not more than of middle size, but was built upon graceful and active lines. His face was swarthy, almost Oriental, with large, dark, languorous eyes which might easily hold an irresistible fascination for women. His hair and moustache were raven black, the latter short, pointed, and carefully waxed. His features were regular and pleasing, save only his straight, thin-lipped mouth. If ever I saw a murderer's mouth it was there--a cruel, hard gash in the face, compressed, inexorable, and terrible. He was ill-advised to train his moustache away from it, for it was Nature's danger-signal, set as a warning to his victims. His voice was engaging and his manners perfect. In age I should have put him at little over thirty, though his record afterwards showed that he was forty-two. Very fine--very fine indeed! he said at last. And you say you have a set of six to correspond. What puzzles me is that I should not have heard of such magnificent specimens. I only know of one in England to match this, and it is certainly not likely to be in the market. Would it be indiscreet if I were to ask you, Dr. Hill Barton, how you obtained this? Does it really matter? I asked, with as careless an air as I could muster. You can see that the piece is genuine, and, as to the value, I am content to take an expert's valuation. Very mysterious, said he, with a quick, suspicious flash of his dark eyes. In dealing with objects of such value, one naturally wishes to know all about the transaction. That the piece is genuine is certain. I have no doubts at all about that. But suppose--I am bound to take every possibility into account--that it should prove afterwards that you had no right to sell? I would guarantee you against any claim of the sort. That, of course, would open up the question as to what your guarantee was worth. My bankers would answer that. Quite so. And yet the whole transaction strikes me as rather unusual. You can do business or not, said I, with indifference. I have given you the first offer as I understood that you were a connoisseur, but I shall have no difficulty in other quarters. Who told you I was a connoisseur? I was aware that you had written a book upon the subject. Have you read the book? No. Dear me, this becomes more and more difficult for me to understand! You are a connoisseur and collector with a very valuable piece in your collection, and yet you have never troubled to consult the one book which would have told you of the real meaning and value of what you held. How do you explain that? I am a very busy man. I am a doctor in practice. That is no answer. If a man has a hobby he follows it up, whatever his other pursuits may be. You said in your note that you were a connoisseur. So I am. Might I ask you a few questions to test you? I am obliged to tell you, doctor--if you are indeed a doctor--that the incident becomes more and more suspicious. I would ask you what do you know of the Emperor Shomu and how do you associate him with the Shoso-in near Nara? Dear me, does that puzzle you? Tell me a little about the Northern Wei dynasty and its place in the history of ceramics. I sprang from my chair in simulated anger. This is intolerable, sir, said I. I came here to do you a favour, and not to be examined as if I were a schoolboy. My knowledge on these subjects may be second only to your own, but I certainly shall not answer questions which have been put in so offensive a way. He looked at me steadily. The languor had gone from his eyes. They suddenly glared. There was a gleam of teeth from between those cruel lips. What is the game? You are here as a spy. You are an emissary of Holmes. This is a trick that you are playing upon me. The fellow is dying, I hear, so he sends his tools to keep watch upon me. You've made your way in here without leave, and, by God! you may find it harder to get out than to get in. He had sprung to his feet, and I stepped back, bracing myself for an attack, for the man was beside himself with rage. He may have suspected me from the first; certainly this cross-examination had shown him the truth; but it was clear that I could not hope to deceive him. He dived his hand into a side-drawer and rummaged furiously. Then something struck upon his ear, for he stood listening intently. Ah! he cried. Ah! and dashed into the room behind him. Two steps took me to the open door, and my mind will ever carry a clear picture of the scene within. The window leading out to the garden was wide open. Beside it, looking like some terrible ghost, his head girt with bloody bandages, his face drawn and white, stood Sherlock Holmes. The next instant he was through the gap, and I heard the crash of his body among the laurel bushes outside. With a howl of rage the master of the house rushed after him to the open window. And then! It was done in an instant, and yet I clearly saw it. An arm--a woman's arm--shot out from among the leaves. At the same instant the Baron uttered a horrible cry--a yell which will always ring in my memory. He clapped his two hands to his face and rushed round the room, beating his head horribly against the walls. Then he fell upon the carpet, rolling and writhing, while scream after scream resounded through the house. Water! For God's sake, water! was his cry. I seized a carafe from a side-table and rushed to his aid. At the same moment the butler and several footmen ran in from the hall. I remember that one of them fainted as I knelt by the injured man and turned that awful face to the light of the lamp. The vitriol was eating into it everywhere and dripping from the ears and the chin. One eye was already white and glazed. The other was red and inflamed. The features which I had admired a few minutes before were now like some beautiful painting over which the artist has passed a wet and foul sponge. They were blurred, discoloured, inhuman, terrible. In a few words I explained exactly what had occurred, so far as the vitriol attack was concerned. Some had climbed through the window and others had rushed out on to the lawn, but it was dark and it had begun to rain. Between his screams the victim raged and raved against the avenger. It was that hell-cat, Kitty Winter! he cried. Oh, the she-devil! She shall pay for it! She shall pay! Oh, God in heaven, this pain is more than I can bear! I bathed his face in oil, put cotton wadding on the raw surfaces, and administered a hypodermic of morphia. All suspicion of me had passed from his mind in the presence of this shock, and he clung to my hands as if I might have the power even yet to clear those dead-fish eyes which gazed up at me. I could have wept over the ruin had I not remembered very clearly the vile life which had led up to so hideous a change. It was loathsome to feel the pawing of his burning hands, and I was relieved when his family surgeon, closely followed by a specialist, came to relieve me of my charge. An inspector of police had also arrived, and to him I handed my real card. It would have been useless as well as foolish to do otherwise, for I was nearly as well known by sight at the Yard as Holmes himself. Then I left that house of gloom and terror. Within an hour I was at Baker Street. Holmes was seated in his familiar chair, looking very pale and exhausted. Apart from his injuries, even his iron nerves had been shocked by the events of the evening, and he listened with horror to my account of the Baron's transformation. The wages of sin, Watson--the wages of sin! said he. Sooner or later it will always come. God knows, there was sin enough, he added, taking up a brown volume from the table. Here is the book the woman talked of. If this will not break off the marriage, nothing ever could. But it will, Watson. It must. No self-respecting woman could stand it. It is his love diary? Or his lust diary. Call it what you will. The moment the woman told us of it I realized what a tremendous weapon was there, if we could but lay our hands on it. I said nothing at the time to indicate my thoughts, for this woman might have given it away. But I brooded over it. Then this assault upon me gave me the chance of letting the Baron think that no precautions need be taken against me. That was all to the good. I would have waited a little longer, but his visit to America forced my hand. He would never have left so compromising a document behind him. Therefore we had to act at once. Burglary at night is impossible. He takes precautions. But there was a chance in the evening if I could only be sure that his attention was engaged. That was where you and your blue saucer came in. But I had to be sure of the position of the book, and I knew I had only a few minutes in which to act, for my time was limited by your knowledge of Chinese pottery. Therefore I gathered the girl up at the last moment. How could I guess what the little packet was that she carried so carefully under her cloak? I thought she had come altogether on my business, but it seems she had some of her own. He guessed I came from you. I feared he would. But you held him in play just long enough for me to get the book, though not long enough for an unobserved escape. Ah, Sir James, I am very glad you have come! Our courtly friend had appeared in answer to a previous summons. He listened with the deepest attention to Holmes's account of what had occurred. You have done wonders--wonders! he cried, when he had heard the narrative. But if these injuries are as terrible as Dr. Watson describes, then surely our purpose of thwarting the marriage is sufficiently gained without the use of this horrible book. Holmes shook his head. Women of the de Merville type do not act like that. She would love him the more as a disfigured martyr. No, no. It is his moral side, not his physical, which we have to destroy. That book will bring her back to earth--and I know nothing else that could. It is in his own writing. She cannot get past it. Sir James carried away both it and the precious saucer. As I was myself overdue, I went down with him into the street. A brougham was waiting for him. He sprang in, gave a hurried order to the cockaded coachman, and drove swiftly away. He flung his overcoat half out of the window to cover the armorial bearings upon the panel, but I had seen them in the glare of our fanlight none the less. I gasped with surprise. Then I turned back and ascended the stair to Holmes's room. I have found out who our client is, I cried, bursting with my great news. Why, Holmes, it is---- It is a loyal friend and a chivalrous gentleman, said Holmes, holding up a restraining hand. Let that now and for ever be enough for us. I do not know how the incriminating book was used. Sir James may have managed it. Or it is more probable that so delicate a task was entrusted to the young lady's father. The effect, at any rate, was all that could be desired. Three days later appeared a paragraph in _The Morning Post_ to say that the marriage between Baron Adelbert Gruner and Miss Violet de Merville would not take place. The same paper had the first police-court hearing of the proceedings against Miss Kitty Winter on the grave charge of vitriol-throwing. Such extenuating circumstances came out in the trial that the sentence, as will be remembered, was the lowest that was possible for such an offence. Sherlock Holmes was threatened with a prosecution for burglary, but when an object is good and a client is sufficiently illustrious, even the rigid British law becomes human and elastic. My friend has not yet stood in the dock. II THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLANCHED SOLDIER The ideas of my friend Watson, though limited, are exceedingly pertinacious. For a long time he has worried me to write an experience of my own. Perhaps I have rather invited this persecution, since I have often had occasion to point out to him how superficial are his own accounts and to accuse him of pandering to popular taste instead of confining himself rigidly to facts and figures. Try it yourself, Holmes! he has retorted, and I am compelled to admit that, having taken my pen in my hand, I do begin to realize that the matter must be presented in such a way as may interest the reader. The following case can hardly fail to do so, as it is among the strangest happenings in my collection, though it chanced that Watson had no note of it in his collection. Speaking of my old friend and biographer, I would take this opportunity to remark that if I burden myself with a companion in my various little inquiries it is not done out of sentiment or caprice, but it is that Watson has some remarkable characteristics of his own, to which in his modesty he has given small attention amid his exaggerated estimates of my own performances. A confederate who foresees your conclusions and course of action is always dangerous, but one to whom each development comes as a perpetual surprise, and to whom the future is always a closed book, is, indeed, an ideal helpmate. I find from my notebook that it was in January, 1903, just after the conclusion of the Boer War, that I had my visit from Mr. James M. Dodd, a big, fresh, sunburned, upstanding Briton. The good Watson had at that time deserted me for a wife, the only selfish action which I can recall in our association. I was alone. It is my habit to sit with my back to the window and to place my visitors in the opposite chair, where the light falls full upon them. Mr. James M. Dodd seemed somewhat at a loss how to begin the interview. I did not attempt to help him, for his silence gave me more time for observation. I have found it wise to impress clients with a sense of power, and so I gave him some of my conclusions. From South Africa, sir, I perceive. Yes, sir, he answered, with some surprise. Imperial Yeomanry, I fancy. Exactly. Middlesex Corps, no doubt. That is so. Mr. Holmes, you are a wizard. I smiled at his bewildered expression. When a gentleman of virile appearance enters my room with such tan upon his face as an English sun could never give, and with his handkerchief in his sleeve instead of in his pocket, it is not difficult to place him. You wear a short beard, which shows that you were not a regular. You have the cut of a riding-man. As to Middlesex, your card has already shown me that you are a stockbroker from Throgmorton Street. What other regiment would you join? You see everything. I see no more than you, but I have trained myself to notice what I see. However, Mr. Dodd, it was not to discuss the science of observation that you called upon me this morning. What has been happening at Tuxbury Old Park? Mr. Holmes----! My dear sir, there is no mystery. Your letter came with that heading, and as you fixed this appointment in very pressing terms it was clear that something sudden and important had occurred. Yes, indeed. But the letter was written in the afternoon, and a good deal has happened since then. If Colonel Emsworth had not kicked me out---- Kicked you out! Well, that was what it amounted to. He is a hard nail, is Colonel Emsworth. The greatest martinet in the Army in his day, and it was a day of rough language, too. I couldn't have stuck the Colonel if it had not been for Godfrey's sake. I lit my pipe and leaned back in my chair. Perhaps you will explain what you are talking about. My client grinned mischievously. I had got into the way of supposing that you knew everything without being told, said he. But I will give you the facts, and I hope to God that you will be able to tell me what they mean. I've been awake all night puzzling my brain, and the more I think the more incredible does it become. When I joined up in January, 1901--just two years ago--young Godfrey Emsworth had joined the same squadron. He was Colonel Emsworth's only son--Emsworth, the Crimean V.C.--and he had the fighting blood in him, so it is no wonder he volunteered. There was not a finer lad in the regiment. We formed a friendship--the sort of friendship which can only be made when one lives the same life and shares the same joys and sorrows. He was my mate--and that means a good deal in the Army. We took the rough and the smooth together for a year of hard fighting. Then he was hit with a bullet from an elephant gun in the action near Diamond Hill outside Pretoria. I got one letter from the hospital at Cape Town and one from Southampton. Since then not a word--not one word, Mr. Holmes, for six months and more, and he my closest pal. Well, when the war was over, and we all got back, I wrote to his father and asked where Godfrey was. No answer. I waited a bit and then I wrote again. This time I had a reply, short and gruff. Godfrey had gone on a voyage round the world, and it was not likely that he would be back for a year. That was all. I wasn't satisfied, Mr. Holmes. The whole thing seemed to me so damned unnatural. He was a good lad and he would not drop a pal like that. It was not like him. Then, again, I happened to know that he was heir to a lot of money, and also that his father and he did not always hit it off too well. The old man was sometimes a bully, and young Godfrey had too much spirit to stand it. No, I wasn't satisfied, and I determined that I would get to the root of the matter. It happened, however, that my own affairs needed a lot of straightening out, after two years' absence, and so it is only this week that I have been able to take up Godfrey's case again. But since I have taken it up I mean to drop everything in order to see it through. Mr. James M. Dodd appeared to be the sort of person whom it would be better to have as a friend than as an enemy. His blue eyes were stern and his square jaw had set hard as he spoke. Well, what have you done? I asked. My first move was to get down to his home, Tuxbury Old Park, near Bedford, and to see for myself how the ground lay. I wrote to the mother, therefore--I had had quite enough of the curmudgeon of a father--and I made a clean frontal attack: Godfrey was my chum, I had a great deal of interest which I might tell her of our common experiences, I should be in the neighbourhood, would there be any objection, et cetera? In reply I had quite an amiable answer from her and an offer to put me up for the night. That was what took me down on Monday. Tuxbury Old Hall is inaccessible--five miles from anywhere. There was no trap at the station, so I had to walk, carrying my suit-case, and it was nearly dark before I arrived. It is a great wandering house, standing in a considerable park. I should judge it was of all sorts of ages and styles, starting on a half-timbered Elizabethan foundation and ending in a Victorian portico. Inside it was all panelling and tapestry and half-effaced old pictures, a house of shadows and mystery. There was a butler, old Ralph, who seemed about the same age as the house and there was his wife, who might have been older. She had been Godfrey's nurse, and I had heard him speak of her as second only to his mother in his affections, so I was drawn to her in spite of her queer appearance. The mother I liked also--a gentle little white mouse of a woman. It was only the Colonel himself whom I barred. We had a bit of a barney right away, and I should have walked back to the station if I had not felt that it might be playing his game for me to do so. I was shown straight into his study, and there I found him, a huge, bow-backed man with a smoky skin and a straggling grey beard, seated behind his littered desk. A red-veined nose jutted out like a vulture's beak, and two fierce grey eyes glared at me from under tufted brows. I could understand now why Godfrey seldom spoke of his father. 'Well, sir,' said he in a rasping voice. 'I should be interested to know the real reasons for this visit.' I answered that I had explained them in my letter to his wife. 'Yes, yes; you said that you had known Godfrey in Africa. We have, of course, only your word for that.' 'I have his letters to me in my pocket.' 'Kindly let me see them.' He glanced at the two which I handed him, and then he tossed them back. 'Well, what then?' he asked. 'I was fond of your son Godfrey, sir. Many ties and memories united us. Is it not natural that I should wonder at his sudden silence and should wish to know what has become of him?' 'I have some recollection, sir, that I had already corresponded with you and had told you what had become of him. He has gone upon a voyage round the world. His health was in a poor way after his African experiences, and both his mother and I were of opinion that complete rest and change were needed. Kindly pass that explanation on to any other friends who may be interested in the matter.' 'Certainly,' I answered. 'But perhaps you would have the goodness to let me have the name of the steamer and of the line by which he sailed, together with the date. I have no doubt that I should be able to get a letter through to him.' My request seemed both to puzzle and to irritate my host. His great eyebrows came down over his eyes and he tapped his fingers impatiently on the table. He looked up at last with the expression of one who has seen his adversary make a dangerous move at chess, and has decided how to meet it. 'Many people, Mr. Dodd,' said he, 'would take offence at your infernal pertinacity and would think that this insistence had reached the point of damned impertinence.' 'You must put it down, sir, to my real love for your son.' 'Exactly. I have already made every allowance upon that score. I must ask you, however, to drop these inquiries. Every family has its own inner knowledge and its own motives, which cannot always be made clear to outsiders, however well-intentioned. My wife is anxious to hear something of Godfrey's past which you are in a position to tell her, but I would ask you to let the present and the future alone. Such inquiries serve no useful purpose, sir, and place us in a delicate and difficult position.' So I came to a dead end, Mr. Holmes. There was no getting past it. I could only pretend to accept the situation and register a vow inwardly that I would never rest until my friend's fate had been cleared up. It was a dull evening. We dined quietly, the three of us, in a gloomy, faded old room. The lady questioned me eagerly about her son, but the old man seemed morose and depressed. I was so bored by the whole proceeding that I made an excuse as soon as I decently could and retired to my bedroom. It was a large, bare room on the ground floor, as gloomy as the rest of the house, but after a year of sleeping upon the veldt, Mr. Holmes, one is not too particular about one's quarters. I opened the curtains and looked out into the garden, remarking that it was a fine night with a bright half-moon. Then I sat down by the roaring fire with the lamp on a table beside me, and endeavoured to distract my mind with a novel. I was interrupted, however, by Ralph, the old butler, who came in with a fresh supply of coals. 'I thought you might run short in the night-time, sir. It is bitter weather and these rooms are cold.' He hesitated before leaving the room, and when I looked round he was standing facing me with a wistful look upon his wrinkled face. 'Beg your pardon, sir, but I could not help hearing what you said of young Master Godfrey at dinner. You know, sir, that my wife nursed him, and so I may say I am his foster-father. It's natural we should take an interest. And you say he carried himself well, sir?' 'There was no braver man in the regiment. He pulled me out once from under the rifles of the Boers, or maybe I should not be here.' The old butler rubbed his skinny hands. 'Yes, sir, yes, that is Master Godfrey all over. He was always courageous. There's not a tree in the park, sir, that he has not climbed. Nothing would stop him. He was a fine boy--and oh, sir, he was a fine man.' I sprang to my feet. 'Look here!' I cried. 'You say he was. You speak as if he were dead. What is all this mystery? What has become of Godfrey Emsworth?' I gripped the old man by the shoulder, but he shrank away. 'I don't know what you mean, sir. Ask the master about Master Godfrey. He knows. It is not for me to interfere.' He was leaving the room, but I held his arm. 'Listen,' I said. 'You are going to answer one question before you leave if I have to hold you all night. Is Godfrey dead?' He could not face my eyes. He was like a man hypnotized. The answer was dragged from his lips. It was a terrible and unexpected one. 'I wish to God he was!' he cried, and, tearing himself free, he dashed from the room. You will think, Mr. Holmes, that I returned to my chair in no very happy state of mind. The old man's words seemed to me to bear only one interpretation. Clearly my poor friend had become involved in some criminal, or, at the least, disreputable, transaction which touched the family honour. That stern old man had sent his son away and hidden him from the world lest some scandal should come to light. Godfrey was a reckless fellow. He was easily influenced by those around him. No doubt he had fallen into bad hands and been misled to his ruin. It was a piteous business, if it was indeed so, but even now it was my duty to hunt him out and see if I could aid him. I was anxiously pondering the matter when I looked up, and there was Godfrey Emsworth standing before me. My client had paused as one in deep emotion. Pray continue, I said. Your problem presents some very unusual features. He was outside the window, Mr. Holmes, with his face pressed against the glass. I have told you that I looked out at the night. When I did so, I left the curtains partly open. His figure was framed in this gap. The window came down to the ground and I could see the whole length of it, but it was his face which held my gaze. He was deadly pale--never have I seen a man so white. I reckon ghosts may look like that; but his eyes met mine, and they were the eyes of a living man. He sprang back when he saw that I was looking at him, and he vanished into the darkness. There was something shocking about the man, Mr. Holmes. It wasn't merely that ghastly face glimmering as white as cheese in the darkness. It was more subtle than that--something slinking, something furtive, something guilty--something very unlike the frank, manly lad that I had known. It left a feeling of horror in my mind. But when a man has been soldiering for a year or two with brother Boer as a playmate, he keeps his nerve and acts quickly. Godfrey had hardly vanished before I was at the window. There was an awkward catch, and I was some little time before I could throw it up. Then I nipped through and ran down the garden path in the direction that I thought he might have taken. It was a long path and the light was not very good but it seemed to me something was moving ahead of me. I ran on and called his name, but it was no use. When I got to the end of the path there were several others branching in different directions to various outhouses. I stood hesitating, and as I did so I heard distinctly the sound of a closing door. It was not behind me in the house, but ahead of me, somewhere in the darkness. That was enough, Mr. Holmes, to assure me that what I had seen was not a vision. Godfrey had run away from me and he had shut a door behind him. Of that I was certain. There was nothing more I could do, and I spent an uneasy night turning the matter over in my mind and trying to find some theory which would cover the facts. Next day I found the Colonel rather more conciliatory, and as his wife remarked that there were some places of interest in the neighbourhood, it gave me an opening to ask whether my presence for one more night would incommode them. A somewhat grudging acquiescence from the old man gave me a clear day in which to make my observations. I was already perfectly convinced that Godfrey was in hiding somewhere near, but where and why remained to be solved. The house was so large and so rambling that a regiment might be hid away in it and no one the wiser. If the secret lay there, it was difficult for me to penetrate it. But the door which I had heard close was certainly not in the house. I must explore the garden and see what I could find. There was no difficulty in the way, for the old people were busy in their own fashion and left me to my own devices. There were several small outhouses, but at the end of the garden there was a detached building of some size--large enough for a gardener's or a gamekeeper's residence. Could this be the place whence the sound of that shutting door had come? I approached it in a careless fashion, as though I were strolling aimlessly round the grounds. As I did so, a small, brisk, bearded man in a black coat and bowler hat--not at all the gardener type--came out of the door. To my surprise, he locked it after him and put the key in his pocket. Then he looked at me with some surprise on his face. 'Are you a visitor here?' he asked. I explained that I was and that I was a friend of Godfrey's. 'What a pity that he should be away on his travels, for he would have so liked to see me,' I continued. 'Quite so. Exactly,' said he, with a rather guilty air. 'No doubt you will renew your visit at some more propitious time.' He passed on, but when I turned I observed that he was standing watching me, half-concealed by the laurels at the far end of the garden. I had a good look at the little house as I passed it, but the windows were heavily curtained, and, so far as one could see, it was empty. I might spoil my own game, and even be ordered off the premises, if I were too audacious, for I was still conscious that I was being watched. Therefore, I strolled back to the house and waited for night before I went on with my inquiry. When all was dark and quiet, I slipped out of my window and made my way as silently as possible to the mysterious lodge. I have said that it was heavily curtained, but now I found that the windows were shuttered as well. Some light, however, was breaking through one of them, so I concentrated my attention upon this. I was in luck, for the curtain had not been quite closed, and there was a crack in the shutter so that I could see the inside of the room. It was a cheery place enough, a bright lamp and a blazing fire. Opposite to me was seated the little man whom I had seen in the morning. He was smoking a pipe and reading a paper. What paper? I asked. My client seemed annoyed at the interruption of his narrative. Can it matter? he asked. It is most essential. I really took no notice. Possibly you observed whether it was a broad-leafed paper or of that smaller type which one associates with weeklies. Now that you mention it, it was not large. It might have been _The Spectator_. However, I had little thought to spare upon such details, for a second man was seated with his back to the window, and I could swear that this second man was Godfrey. I could not see his face, but I knew the familiar slope of his shoulders. He was leaning upon his elbow in an attitude of great melancholy, his body turned towards the fire. I was hesitating as to what I should do when there was a sharp tap on my shoulder, and there was Colonel Emsworth beside me. 'This way, sir!' said he in a low voice. He walked in silence to the house and I followed him into my own bedroom. He had picked up a timetable in the hall. 'There is a train to London at eight-thirty,' said he. 'The trap will be at the door at eight.' He was white with rage, and, indeed, I felt myself in so difficult a position that I could only stammer out a few incoherent apologies, in which I tried to excuse myself by urging my anxiety for my friend. 'The matter will not bear discussion,' said he abruptly. 'You have made a most damnable intrusion into the privacy of our family. You were here as a guest and you have become a spy. I have nothing more to say, sir, save that I have no wish ever to see you again.' At this I lost my temper, Mr. Holmes, and I spoke with some warmth. 'I have seen your son, and I am convinced that for some reason of your own you are concealing him from the world. I have no idea what your motives are in cutting him off in this fashion, but I am sure that he is no longer a free agent. I warn you, Colonel Emsworth, that until I am assured as to the safety and well-being of my friend I shall never desist in my efforts to get to the bottom of the mystery, and I shall certainly not allow myself to be intimidated by anything which you may say or do.' The old fellow looked diabolical, and I really thought he was about to attack me. I have said that he was a gaunt, fierce old giant, and though I am no weakling I might have been hard put to it to hold my own against him. However, after a long glare of rage he turned upon his heel and walked out of the room. For my part, I took the appointed train in the morning, with the full intention of coming straight to you and asking for your advice and assistance at the appointment for which I had already written. Such was the problem which my visitor laid before me. It presented, as the astute reader will have already perceived, few difficulties in its solution, for a very limited choice of alternatives must get to the root of the matter. Still, elementary as it was, there were points of interest and novelty about it which may excuse my placing it upon record. I now proceeded, using my familiar method of logical analysis, to narrow down the possible solutions. The servants, I asked; how many were in the house? To the best of my belief there were only the old butler and his wife. They seemed to live in the simplest fashion. There was no servant, then, in the detached house? None, unless the little man with the beard acted as such. He seemed, however, to be quite a superior person. That seems very suggestive. Had you any indication that food was conveyed from the one house to the other? Now that you mention it, I did see old Ralph carrying a basket down the garden walk and going in the direction of this house. The idea of food did not occur to me at the moment. Did you make any local inquiries? Yes, I did. I spoke to the station-master and also to the innkeeper in the village. I simply asked if they knew anything of my old comrade, Godfrey Emsworth. Both of them assured me that he had gone for a voyage round the world. He had come home and then had almost at once started off again. The story was evidently universally accepted. You said nothing of your suspicions? Nothing. That was very wise. The matter should certainly be inquired into. I will go back with you to Tuxbury Old Park. To-day? It happened that at the moment I was clearing up the case which my friend Watson has described as that of the Abbey School, in which the Duke of Greyminster was so deeply involved. I had also a commission from the Sultan of Turkey which called for immediate action, as political consequences of the gravest kind might arise from its neglect. Therefore it was not until the beginning of the next week, as my diary records, that I was able to start forth on my mission to Bedfordshire in company with Mr. James M. Dodd. As we drove to Euston we picked up a grave and taciturn gentleman of iron-grey aspect, with whom I had made the necessary arrangements. This is an old friend, said I to Dodd. It is possible that his presence may be entirely unnecessary, and, on the other hand, it may be essential. It is not necessary at the present stage to go further into the matter. The narratives of Watson have accustomed the reader, no doubt, to the fact that I do not waste words or disclose my thoughts while a case is actually under consideration. Dodd seemed surprised, but nothing more was said and the three of us continued our journey together. In the train I asked Dodd one more question which I wished our companion to hear. You say that you saw your friend's face quite clearly at the window, so clearly that you are sure of his identity? I have no doubt about it whatever. His nose was pressed against the glass. The lamplight shone full upon him. It could not have been someone resembling him? No, no; it was he. But you say he was changed? Only in colour. His face was--how shall I describe it?--it was of a fish-belly whiteness. It was bleached. Was it equally pale all over? I think not. It was his brow which I saw so clearly as it was pressed against the window. Did you call to him? I was too startled and horrified for the moment. Then I pursued him, as I have told you, but without result. My case was practically complete, and there was only one small incident needed to round it off. When, after a considerable drive, we arrived at the strange old rambling house which my client had described, it was Ralph, the elderly butler, who opened the door. I had requisitioned the carriage for the day and had asked my elderly friend to remain within it unless we should summon him. Ralph, a little wrinkled old fellow, was in the conventional costume of black coat and pepper-and-salt trousers, with only one curious variant. He wore brown leather gloves, which at sight of us he instantly shuffled off, laying them down on the hall-table as we passed in. I have, as my friend Watson may have remarked, an abnormally acute set of senses, and a faint but incisive scent was apparent. It seemed to centre on the hall-table. I turned, placed my hat there, knocked it off, stooped to pick it up, and contrived to bring my nose within a foot of the gloves. Yes, it was undoubtedly from them that the curious tarry odour was oozing. I passed on into the study with my case complete. Alas, that I should have to show my hand so when I tell my own story! It was by concealing such links in the chain that Watson was enabled to produce his meretricious finales. Colonel Emsworth was not in his room, but he came quickly enough on receipt of Ralph's message. We heard his quick, heavy step in the passage. The door was flung open and he rushed in with bristling beard and twisted features, as terrible an old man as ever I have seen. He held our cards in his hand, and he tore them up and stamped on the fragments. Have I not told you, you infernal busybody, that you are warned off the premises? Never dare to show your damned face here again. If you enter again without my leave I shall be within my rights if I use violence. I'll shoot you, sir! By God, I will! As to you, sir, turning upon me, I extend the same warning to you. I am familiar with your ignoble profession, but you must take your reputed talents to some other field. There is no opening for them here. I cannot leave here, said my client firmly, until I hear from Godfrey's own lips that he is under no restraint. Our involuntary host rang the bell. Ralph, he said, telephone down to the county police and ask the inspector to send up two constables. Tell him there are burglars in the house. One moment, said I. You must be aware, Mr. Dodd, that Colonel Emsworth is within his rights and that we have no legal status within his house. On the other hand, he should recognize that your action is prompted entirely by solicitude for his son. I venture to hope that, if I were allowed to have five minutes' conversation with Colonel Emsworth, I could certainly alter his view of the matter. I am not so easily altered, said the old soldier. Ralph, do what I have told you. What the devil are you waiting for? Ring up the police! Nothing of the sort, I said, putting my back to the door. Any police interference would bring about the very catastrophe which you dread. I took out my notebook and scribbled one word upon a loose sheet. That, said I, as I handed it to Colonel Emsworth, is what has brought us here. He stared at the writing with a face from which every expression save amazement had vanished. How do you know? he gasped, sitting down heavily in his chair. It is my business to know things. That is my trade. He sat in deep thought, his gaunt hand tugging at his straggling beard. Then he made a gesture of resignation. Well, if you wish to see Godfrey, you shall. It is no doing of mine, but you have forced my hand. Ralph, tell Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Kent that in five minutes we shall be with them. At the end of that time we passed down the garden path and found ourselves in front of the mystery house at the end. A small bearded man stood at the door with a look of considerable astonishment upon his face. This is very sudden, Colonel Emsworth, said he. This will disarrange all our plans. I can't help it, Mr. Kent. Our hands have been forced. Can Mr. Godfrey see us? Yes; he is waiting inside. He turned and led us into a large, plainly furnished front room. A man was standing with his back to the fire, and at the sight of him my client sprang forward with outstretched hand. Why, Godfrey, old man, this is fine! But the other waved him back. Don't touch me, Jimmie. Keep your distance. Yes, you may well stare! I don't quite look the smart Lance-Corporal Emsworth, of B Squadron, do I? His appearance was certainly extraordinary. One could see that he had indeed been a handsome man with clear-cut features sunburned by an African sun, but mottled in patches over this darker surface were curious whitish patches which had bleached his skin. That's why I don't court visitors, said he. I don't mind you, Jimmie, but I could have done without your friend. I suppose there is some good reason for it, but you have me at a disadvantage. I wanted to be sure that all was well with you, Godfrey. I saw you that night when you looked into my window, and I could not let the matter rest till I had cleared things up. Old Ralph told me you were there, and I couldn't help taking a peep at you. I hoped you would not have seen me, and I had to run to my burrow when I heard the window go up. But what in Heaven's name is the matter? Well, it's not a long story to tell, said he, lighting a cigarette. You remember that morning fight at Buffelsspruit, outside Pretoria, on the Eastern railway line? You heard I was hit? Yes, I heard that, but I never got particulars. Three of us got separated from the others. It was very broken country, you may remember. There was Simpson--the fellow we called Baldy Simpson--and Anderson, and I. We were clearing brother Boer, but he lay low and got the three of us. The other two were killed. I got an elephant bullet through my shoulder. I stuck on to my horse, however, and he galloped several miles before I fainted and rolled off the saddle. When I came to myself it was nightfall, and I raised myself up, feeling very weak and ill. To my surprise there was a house close beside me, a fairly large house with a broad stoep and many windows. It was deadly cold. You remember the kind of numb cold which used to come at evening, a deadly, sickening sort of cold, very different from a crisp healthy frost. Well, I was chilled to the bone, and my only hope seemed to lie in reaching that house. I staggered to my feet and dragged myself along, hardly conscious of what I did. I have a dim memory of slowly ascending the steps, entering a wide-opened door, passing into a large room which contained several beds, and throwing myself down with a gasp of satisfaction upon one of them. It was unmade, but that troubled me not at all. I drew the clothes over my shivering body and in a moment I was in a deep sleep. It was morning when I wakened, and it seemed to me that instead of coming out into a world of sanity I had emerged into some extraordinary nightmare. The African sun flooded through the big, curtainless windows, and every detail of the great, bare, whitewashed dormitory stood out hard and clear. In front of me was standing a small, dwarf-like man with a huge, bulbous head, who was jabbering excitedly in Dutch, waving two horrible hands which looked to me like brown sponges. Behind him stood a group of people who seemed to be intensely amused by the situation, but a chill came over me as I looked at them. Not one of them was a normal human being. Every one was twisted or swollen or disfigured in some strange way. The laughter of these strange monstrosities was a dreadful thing to hear. It seemed that none of them could speak English, but the situation wanted clearing up, for the creature with the big head was growing furiously angry and, uttering wild beast cries, he had laid his deformed hands upon me and was dragging me out of bed, regardless of the fresh flow of blood from my wound. The little monster was as strong as a bull, and I don't know what he might have done to me had not an elderly man who was clearly in authority been attracted to the room by the hubbub. He said a few stern words in Dutch and my persecutor shrank away. Then he turned upon me, gazing at me in the utmost amazement. 'How in the world did you come here?' he asked, in amazement. 'Wait a bit! I see that you are tired out and that wounded shoulder of yours wants looking after. I am a doctor, and I'll soon have you tied up. But, man alive! you are in far greater danger here than ever you were on the battlefield. You are in the Leper Hospital, and you have slept in a leper's bed.' Need I tell you more, Jimmie? It seems that in view of the approaching battle all these poor creatures had been evacuated the day before. Then, as the British advanced, they had been brought back by this, their medical superintendent, who assured me that, though he believed he was immune to the disease, he would none the less never have dared to do what I had done. He put me in a private room, treated me kindly, and within a week or so I was removed to the general hospital at Pretoria. So there you have my tragedy. I hoped against hope, but it was not until I had reached home that the terrible signs which you see upon my face told me that I had not escaped. What was I to do? I was in this lonely house. We had two servants whom we could utterly trust. There was a house where I could live. Under pledge of secrecy, Mr. Kent, who is a surgeon, was prepared to stay with me. It seemed simple enough on those lines. The alternative was a dreadful one--segregation for life among strangers with never a hope of release. But absolute secrecy was necessary, or even in this quiet country-side there would have been an outcry, and I should have been dragged to my horrible doom. Even you, Jimmie--even you had to be kept in the dark. Why my father has relented I cannot imagine. Colonel Emsworth pointed to me. This is the gentleman who forced my hand. He unfolded the scrap of paper on which I had written the word Leprosy. It seemed to me that if he knew so much as that it was safer that he should know all. And so it was, said I. Who knows but good may come of it? I understand that only Mr. Kent has seen the patient. May I ask, sir, if you are an authority on such complaints, which are, I understand, tropical or semi-tropical in their nature? I have the ordinary knowledge of the educated medical man, he observed, with some stiffness. I have no doubt, sir, that you are fully competent, but I am sure that you will agree that in such a case a second opinion is valuable. You have avoided this, I understand, for fear that pressure should be put upon you to segregate the patient. That is so, said Colonel Emsworth. I foresaw this situation, I explained, and I have brought with me a friend whose discretion may absolutely be trusted. I was able once to do him a professional service, and he is ready to advise as a friend rather than as a specialist. His name is Sir James Saunders. The prospect of an interview with Lord Roberts would not have excited greater wonder and pleasure in a raw subaltern than was now reflected upon the face of Mr. Kent. I shall indeed be proud, he murmured. Then I will ask Sir James to step this way. He is at present in the carriage outside the door. Meanwhile, Colonel Emsworth, we may perhaps assemble in your study, where I could give the necessary explanations. And here it is that I miss my Watson. By cunning questions and ejaculations of wonder he could elevate my simple art, which is but systematized common sense, into a prodigy. When I tell my own story I have no such aid. And yet I will give my process of thought even as I gave it to my small audience, which included Godfrey's mother, in the study of Colonel Emsworth. That process, said I, starts upon the supposition that when you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains however improbable, must be the truth. It may well be that several explanations remain, in which case one tries test after test until one or other of them has a convincing amount of support. We will now apply this principle to the case in point. As it was first presented to me, there were three possible explanations of the seclusion or incarceration of this gentleman in an outhouse of his father's mansion. There was the explanation that he was in hiding for a crime, or that he was mad and that they wished to avoid an asylum, or that he had some disease which caused his segregation. I could think of no other adequate solutions. These, then, had to be sifted and balanced against each other. The criminal solution would not bear inspection. No unsolved crime had been reported from that district. I was sure of that. If it were some crime not yet discovered, then clearly it would be to the interest of the family to get rid of the delinquent and send him abroad rather than keep him concealed at home. I could see no explanation for such a line of conduct. Insanity was more plausible. The presence of the second person in the outhouse suggested a keeper. The fact that he locked the door when he came out strengthened the supposition and gave the idea of constraint. On the other hand, this constraint could not be severe or the young man could not have got loose and come down to have a look at his friend. You will remember, Mr. Dodd, that I felt round for points, asking you, for example, about the paper which Mr. Kent was reading. Had it been _The Lancet_ or _The British Medical Journal_ it would have helped me. It is not illegal, however, to keep a lunatic upon private premises so long as there is a qualified person in attendance and that the authorities have been duly notified. Why, then, all this desperate desire for secrecy? Once again I could not get the theory to fit the facts. There remained the third possibility, into which, rare and unlikely as it was, everything seemed to fit. Leprosy is not uncommon in South Africa. By some extraordinary chance this youth might have contracted it. His people would be placed in a very dreadful position, since they would desire to save him from segregation. Great secrecy would be needed to prevent rumours from getting about and subsequent interference by the authorities. A devoted medical man, if sufficiently paid, would easily be found to take charge of the sufferer. There would be no reason why the latter should not be allowed freedom after dark. Bleaching of the skin is a common result of the disease. The case was a strong one--so strong that I determined to act as if it were actually proved. When on arriving here I noticed that Ralph, who carries out the meals, had gloves which are impregnated with disinfectants, my last doubts were removed. A single word showed you, sir, that your secret was discovered, and if I wrote rather than said it, it was to prove to you that my discretion was to be trusted. I was finishing this little analysis of the case when the door was opened and the austere figure of the great dermatologist was ushered in. But for once his sphinx-like features had relaxed and there was a warm humanity in his eyes. He strode up to Colonel Emsworth and shook him by the hand. It is often my lot to bring ill-tidings, and seldom good, said he. This occasion is the more welcome. It is not leprosy. What? A well-marked case of pseudo-leprosy or ichthyosis, a scale-like affection of the skin, unsightly, obstinate, but possibly curable, and certainly non-infective. Yes, Mr. Holmes, the coincidence is a remarkable one. But is it coincidence? Are there not subtle forces at work of which we know little? Are we assured that the apprehension, from which this young man has no doubt suffered terribly since his exposure to its contagion, may not produce a physical effect which simulates that which it fears? At any rate, I pledge my professional reputation---- But the lady has fainted! I think that Mr. Kent had better be with her until she recovers from this joyous shock. III THE ADVENTURE OF THE MAZARIN STONE It was pleasant to Dr. Watson to find himself once more in the untidy room of the first floor in Baker Street which had been the starting-point of so many remarkable adventures. He looked round him at the scientific charts upon the wall, the acid-charred bench of chemicals, the violin-case leaning in the corner, the coal-scuttle, which contained of old the pipes and tobacco. Finally, his eyes came round to the fresh and smiling face of Billy, the young but very wise and tactful page, who had helped a little to fill up the gap of loneliness and isolation which surrounded the saturnine figure of the great detective. It all seems very unchanged, Billy. You don't change, either. I hope the same can be said of him? Billy glanced, with some solicitude, at the closed door of the bedroom. I think he's in bed and asleep, he said. It was seven in the evening of a lovely summer's day, but Dr. Watson was sufficiently familiar with the irregularity of his old friend's hours to feel no surprise at the idea. That means a case, I suppose? Yes, sir; he is very hard at it just now. I'm frightened for his health. He gets paler and thinner, and he eats nothing. 'When will you be pleased to dine, Mr. Holmes?' Mrs. Hudson asked. 'Seven-thirty, the day after to-morrow,' said he. You know his way when he is keen on a case. Yes, Billy, I know. He's following someone. Yesterday he was out as a workman looking for a job. To-day he was an old woman. Fairly took me in, he did, and I ought to know his ways by now. Billy pointed with a grin to a very baggy parasol which leaned against the sofa. That's part of the old woman's outfit, he said. But what is it all about, Billy? Billy sank his voice, as one who discusses great secrets of State. I don't mind telling you, sir, but it should go no farther. It's this case of the Crown diamond. What--the hundred-thousand-pound burglary? Yes, sir. They must get it back, sir. Why, we had the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary both sitting on that very sofa. Mr. Holmes was very nice to them. He soon put them at their ease and promised he would do all he could. Then there is Lord Cantlemere---- Ah! Yes, sir; you know what that means. He's a stiff 'un, sir, if I may say so. I can get along with the Prime Minister, and I've nothing against the Home Secretary, who seemed a civil, obliging sort of man, but I can't stand his lordship. Neither can Mr. Holmes, sir. You see, he don't believe in Mr. Holmes and he was against employing him. He'd rather he failed. And Mr. Holmes knows it? Mr. Holmes always knows whatever there is to know. Well, we'll hope he won't fail and that Lord Cantlemere will be confounded. But I say, Billy, what is that curtain for across the window? Mr. Holmes had it put up there three days ago. We've got something funny behind it. Billy advanced and drew away the drapery which screened the alcove of the bow window. Dr. Watson could not restrain a cry of amazement. There was a facsimile of his old friend, dressing-gown and all, the face turned three-quarters towards the window and downwards, as though reading an invisible book, while the body was sunk deep in an arm-chair. Billy detached the head and held it in the air. We put it at different angles, so that it may seem more life-like. I wouldn't dare touch it if the blind were not down. But when it's up you can see this from across the way. We used something of the sort once before. Before my time, said Billy. He drew the window curtains apart and looked out into the street. There are folk who watch us from over yonder. I can see a fellow now at the window. Have a look for yourself. Watson had taken a step forward when the bedroom door opened, and the long, thin form of Holmes emerged, his face pale and drawn, but his step and bearing as active as ever. With a single spring he was at the window, and had drawn the blind once more. That will do, Billy, said he. You were in danger of your life then, my boy, and I can't do without you just yet. Well, Watson, it is good to see you in your old quarters once again. You come at a critical moment. So I gather. You can go, Billy. That boy is a problem, Watson. How far am I justified in allowing him to be in danger? Danger of what, Holmes? Of sudden death. I'm expecting something this evening. Expecting what? To be murdered, Watson. No, no; you are joking, Holmes! Even my limited sense of humour could evolve a better joke than that. But we may be comfortable in the meantime, may we not? Is alcohol permitted? The gasogene and cigars are in the old place. Let me see you once more in the customary arm-chair. You have not, I hope, learned to despise my pipe and my lamentable tobacco? It has to take the place of food these days. But why not eat? Because the faculties become refined when you starve them. Why, surely, as a doctor, my dear Watson, you must admit that what your digestion gains in the way of blood supply is so much lost to the brain. I am a brain, Watson. The rest of me is a mere appendix. Therefore, it is the brain I must consider. But this danger, Holmes? Ah, yes; in case it should come off, it would perhaps be as well that you should burden your memory with the name and address of the murderer. You can give it to Scotland Yard, with my love and a parting blessing. Sylvius is the name--Count Negretto Sylvius. Write it down, man, write it down! 136 Moorside Gardens, N.W. Got it? Watson's honest face was twitching with anxiety. He knew only too well the immense risks taken by Holmes, and was well aware that what he said was more likely to be under-statement than exaggeration. Watson was always the man of action, and he rose to the occasion. Count me in, Holmes. I have nothing to do for a day or two. Your morals don't improve, Watson. You have added fibbing to your other vices. You bear every sign of the busy medical man, with calls on him every hour. Not such important ones. But can't you have this fellow arrested? Yes, Watson, I could. That's what worries him so. But why don't you? Because I don't know where the diamond is. Ah! Billy told me--the missing Crown jewel! Yes, the great yellow Mazarin stone. I've cast my net and I have my fish. But I have not got the stone. What is the use of taking _them_? We can make the world a better place by laying them by the heels. But that is not what I am out for. It's the stone I want. And is this Count Sylvius one of your fish? Yes, and he's a shark. He bites. The other is Sam Merton, the boxer. Not a bad fellow, Sam, but the Count has used him. Sam's not a shark. He is a great big silly bull-headed gudgeon. But he is flopping about in my net all the same. Where is this Count Sylvius? I've been at his very elbow all the morning. You've seen me as an old lady, Watson. I was never more convincing. He actually picked up my parasol for me once. 'By your leave, madame,' said he--half-Italian, you know, and with the Southern graces of manner when in the mood, but a devil incarnate in the other mood. Life is full of whimsical happenings, Watson. It might have been tragedy. Well, perhaps it might. I followed him to old Straubenzee's workshop in the Minories. Straubenzee made the air-gun--a very pretty bit of work, as I understand, and I rather fancy it is in the opposite window at the present moment. Have you seen the dummy? Of course, Billy showed it to you. Well, it may get a bullet through its beautiful head at any moment. Ah, Billy, what is it? The boy had reappeared in the room with a card upon a tray. Holmes glanced at it with raised eyebrows and an amused smile. The man himself. I had hardly expected this. Grasp the nettle, Watson! A man of nerve. Possibly you have heard of his reputation as a shooter of big game. It would indeed be a triumphant ending to his excellent sporting record if he added me to his bag. This is a proof that he feels my toe very close behind his heel. Send for the police. I probably shall. But not just yet. Would you glance carefully out of the window, Watson, and see if anyone is hanging about in the street? Watson looked warily round the edge of the curtain. Yes, there is one rough fellow near the door. That will be Sam Merton--the faithful but rather fatuous Sam. Where is this gentleman, Billy? In the waiting-room, sir. Show him up when I ring. Yes, sir. If I am not in the room, show him in all the same. Yes, sir. Watson waited until the door was closed, and then he turned earnestly to his companion. Look here, Holmes, this is simply impossible. This is a desperate man, who sticks at nothing. He may have come to murder you. I should not be surprised. I insist upon staying with you. You would be horribly in the way. In his way? No, my dear fellow--in my way. Well, I can't possibly leave you. Yes, you can, Watson. And you will, for you have never failed to play the game. I am sure you will play it to the end. This man has come for his own purpose, but he may stay for mine. Holmes took out his notebook and scribbled a few lines. Take a cab to Scotland Yard and give this to Youghal of the C.I.D. Come back with the police. The fellow's arrest will follow. I'll do that with joy. Before you return I may have just time enough to find out where the stone is. He touched the bell. I think we will go out through the bedroom. This second exit is exceedingly useful. I rather want to see my shark without his seeing me, and I have, as you will remember, my own way of doing it. It was, therefore, an empty room into which Billy, a minute later, ushered Count Sylvius. The famous game-shot, sportsman, and man-about-town was a big, swarthy fellow, with a formidable dark moustache, shading a cruel, thin-lipped mouth, and surmounted by a long, curved nose, like the beak of an eagle. He was well dressed, but his brilliant necktie, shining pin, and glittering rings were flamboyant in their effect. As the door closed behind him he looked round him with fierce, startled eyes, like one who suspects a trap at every turn. Then he gave a violent start as he saw the impassive head and the collar of the dressing-gown which projected above the arm-chair in the window. At first his expression was one of pure amazement. Then the light of a horrible hope gleamed in his dark, murderous eyes. He took one more glance round to see that there were no witnesses, and then, on tiptoe, his thick stick half raised, he approached the silent figure. He was crouching for his final spring and blow when a cool, sardonic voice greeted him from the open bedroom door: Don't break it, Count! Don't break it! The assassin staggered back, amazement in his convulsed face. For an instant he half raised his loaded cane once more, as if he would turn his violence from the effigy to the original; but there was something in that steady grey eye and mocking smile which caused his hand to sink to his side. It's a pretty little thing, said Holmes, advancing towards the image. Tavernier, the French modeller, made it. He is as good at waxworks as your friend Straubenzee is at air-guns. Air-guns, sir! What do you mean? Put your hat and stick on the side-table. Thank you! Pray take a seat. Would you care to put your revolver out also? Oh, very good, if you prefer to sit upon it. Your visit is really most opportune, for I wanted badly to have a few minutes' chat with you. The Count scowled, with heavy, threatening eyebrows. I, too, wished to have some words with you, Holmes. That is why I am here. I won't deny that I intended to assault you just now. Holmes swung his leg on the edge of the table. I rather gathered that you had some idea of the sort in your head, said he. But why these personal attentions? Because you have gone out of your way to annoy me. Because you have put your creatures upon my track. My creatures! I assure you no! Nonsense! I have had them followed. Two can play at that game, Holmes. It is a small point, Count Sylvius, but perhaps you would kindly give me my prefix when you address me. You can understand that, with my routine of work, I should find myself on familiar terms with half the rogues' gallery, and you will agree that exceptions are invidious. Well, _Mr._ Holmes, then. Excellent! But I assure you you are mistaken about my alleged agents. Count Sylvius laughed contemptuously. Other people can observe as well as you. Yesterday there was an old sporting man. To-day it was an elderly woman. They held me in view all day. Really, sir, you compliment me. Old Baron Dowson said the night before he was hanged that in my case what the law had gained the stage had lost. And now you give my little impersonations your kindly praise! It was you--you yourself? Holmes shrugged his shoulders. You can see in the corner the parasol which you so politely handed to me in the Minories before you began to suspect. If I had known, you might never---- Have seen this humble home again. I was well aware of it. We all have neglected opportunities to deplore. As it happens, you did not know, so here we are! The Count's knotted brows gathered more heavily over his menacing eyes. What you say only makes the matter worse. It was not your agents, but your play-acting, busybody self! You admit that you have dogged me. Why? Come now, Count. You used to shoot lions in Algeria. Well? But why? Why? The sport--the excitement--the danger! And, no doubt, to free the country from a pest? Exactly! My reasons in a nutshell! The Count sprang to his feet, and his hand involuntarily moved back to his hip-pocket. Sit down, sir, sit down! There was another, more practical, reason. I want that yellow diamond! Count Sylvius lay back in his chair with an evil smile. Upon my word! said he. You knew that I was after you for that. The real reason why you are here to-night is to find out how much I know about the matter and how far my removal is absolutely essential. Well, I should say that, from your point of view, it is absolutely essential, for I know all about it, save only one thing, which you are about to tell me. Oh, indeed! And, pray, what is this missing fact? Where the Crown diamond now is. The Count looked sharply at his companion. Oh, you want to know that, do you? How the devil should I be able to tell you where it is? You can, and you will. Indeed! You can't bluff me, Count Sylvius. Holmes's eyes, as he gazed at him, contracted and lightened until they were like two menacing points of steel. You are absolute plate-glass. I see to the very back of your mind. Then, of course, you see where the diamond is! Holmes clapped his hands with amusement, and then pointed a derisive finger. Then you do know. You have admitted it! I admit nothing. Now, Count, if you will be reasonable, we can do business. If not, you will get hurt. Count Sylvius threw up his eyes to the ceiling. And you talk about bluff! said he. Holmes looked at him thoughtfully, like a master chess-player who meditates his crowning move. Then he threw open the table drawer and drew out a squat notebook. Do you know what I keep in this book? No, sir, I do not! You! Me? Yes, sir, _you_! You are all here--every action of your vile and dangerous life. Damn you, Holmes! cried the Count, with blazing eyes. There are limits to my patience! It's all here, Count. The real facts as to the death of old Mrs. Harold, who left you the Blymer estate, which you so rapidly gambled away. You are dreaming! And the complete life history of Miss Minnie Warrender. Tut! You will make nothing of that! Plenty more here, Count. Here is the robbery in the train-de-luxe to the Riviera on February 13, 1892. Here is the forged cheque in the same year on the Crédit Lyonnais. No; you're wrong there. Then I am right on the others! Now, Count, you are a card-player. When the other fellow has all the trumps, it saves time to throw down your hand. What has all this talk to do with the jewel of which you spoke? Gently, Count. Restrain that eager mind! Let me get to the points in my own humdrum fashion. I have all this against you; but, above all, I have a clear case against both you and your fighting bully in the case of the Crown diamond. Indeed! I have the cabman who took you to Whitehall and the cabman who brought you away. I have the Commissionaire who saw you near the case. I have Ikey Sanders, who refused to cut it up for you. Ikey has peached, and the game is up. The veins stood out on the Count's forehead. His dark, hairy hands were clenched in a convulsion of restrained emotion. He tried to speak, but the words would not shape themselves. That's the hand I play from, said Holmes. I put it all upon the table. But one card is missing. It's the King of Diamonds. I don't know where the stone is. You never shall know. No? Now, be reasonable, Count. Consider the situation. You are going to be locked up for twenty years. So is Sam Merton. What good are you going to get out of your diamond? None in the world. But if you hand it over--well, I'll compound a felony. We don't want you or Sam. We want the stone. Give that up, and so far as I am concerned you can go free so long as you behave yourself in the future. If you make another slip--well, it will be the last. But this time my commission is to get the stone, not you. But if I refuse? Why, then--alas!--it must be you and not the stone. Billy had appeared in answer to a ring. I think, Count, that it would be as well to have your friend Sam at this conference. After all, his interests should be represented. Billy, you will see a large and ugly gentleman outside the front door. Ask him to come up. If he won't come, sir? No violence, Billy. Don't be rough with him. If you tell him that Count Sylvius wants him he will certainly come. What are you going to do now? asked the Count, as Billy disappeared. My friend Watson was with me just now. I told him that I had a shark and a gudgeon in my net; now I am drawing the net and up they come together. The Count had risen from his chair, and his hand was behind his back. Holmes held something half protruding from the pocket of his dressing-gown. You won't die in your bed, Holmes. I have often had the same idea. Does it matter very much? After all, Count, your own exit is more likely to be perpendicular than horizontal. But these anticipations of the future are morbid. Why not give ourselves up to the unrestrained enjoyment of the present? A sudden wild-beast light sprang up in the dark, menacing eyes of the master criminal. Holmes's figure seemed to grow taller as he grew tense and ready. It is no use your fingering your revolver, my friend, he said, in a quiet voice. You know perfectly well that you dare not use it, even if I gave you time to draw it. Nasty, noisy things, revolvers, Count. Better stick to air-guns. Ah! I think I hear the fairy footstep of your estimable partner. Good day, Mr. Merton. Rather dull in the street, is it not? The prize-fighter, a heavily built young man with a stupid, obstinate, slab-sided face, stood awkwardly at the door, looking about him with a puzzled expression. Holmes's debonair manner was a new experience, and though he vaguely felt that it was hostile, he did not know how to counter it. He turned to his more astute comrade for help. What's the game now, Count? What's this fellow want? What's up? His voice was deep and raucous. The Count shrugged his shoulders and it was Holmes who answered. If I may put it in a nutshell, Mr. Merton, I should say it was _all_ up. The boxer still addressed his remarks to his associate. Is this cove trying to be funny, or what? I'm not in the funny mood myself. No, I expect not, said Holmes. I think I can promise you that you will feel even less humorous as the evening advances. Now, look here, Count Sylvius. I'm a busy man and I can't waste time. I'm going into that bedroom. Pray make yourselves quite at home in my absence. You can explain to your friend how the matter lies without the restraint of my presence. I shall try over the Hoffmann Barcarolle upon my violin. In five minutes I shall return for your final answer. You quite grasp the alternative, do you not? Shall we take you, or shall we have the stone? Holmes withdrew, picking up his violin from the corner as he passed. A few moments later the long-drawn, wailing notes of that most haunting of tunes came faintly through the closed door of the bedroom. What is it, then? asked Merton anxiously, as his companion turned to him. Does he know about the stone? He knows a damned sight too much about it. I'm not sure that he doesn't know all about it. Good Lord! The boxer's sallow face turned a shade whiter. Ikey Sanders has split on us. He has, has he? I'll do him down a thick 'un for that if I swing for it. That won't help us much. We've got to make up our minds what to do. Half a mo', said the boxer, looking suspiciously at the bedroom door. He's a leary cove that wants watching. I suppose he's not listening? How can he be listening with that music going? That's right. Maybe somebody's behind a curtain. Too many curtains in this room. As he looked round he suddenly saw for the first time the effigy in the window, and stood staring and pointing, too amazed for words. Tut! it's only a dummy, said the Count. A fake, is it? Well, strike me! Madame Tussaud ain't in it. It's the living spit of him, gown and all. But them curtains, Count! Oh, confound the curtains! We are wasting our time, and there is none too much. He can lag us over this stone. The deuce he can! But he'll let us slip if we only tell him where the swag is. What! Give it up? Give up a hundred thousand quid? It's one or the other. Merton scratched his short-cropped pate. He's alone in there. Let's do him in. If his light were out we should have nothing to fear. The Count shook his head. He is armed and ready. If we shot him we could hardly get away in a place like this. Besides, it's likely enough that the police know whatever evidence he has got. Hallo! What was that? There was a vague sound which seemed to come from the window. Both men sprang round, but all was quiet. Save for the one strange figure seated in the chair, the room was certainly empty. Something in the street, said Merton. Now look here, guv'nor, you've got the brains. Surely you can think a way out of it. If slugging is no use then it's up to you. I've fooled better men than he, the Count answered. The stone is here in my secret pocket. I take no chances leaving it about. It can be out of England to-night and cut into four pieces in Amsterdam before Sunday. He knows nothing of Van Seddar. I thought Van Seddar was going next week. He _was_. But now he must get off by the next boat. One or other of us must slip round with the stone to Lime Street and tell him. But the false bottom ain't ready. Well, he must take it as it is and chance it. There's not a moment to lose. Again, with the sense of danger which becomes an instinct with the sportsman, he paused and looked hard at the window. Yes, it was surely from the street that the faint sound had come. As to Holmes, he continued, we can fool him easily enough. You see, the damned fool won't arrest us if he can get the stone. Well, we'll promise him the stone. We'll put him on the wrong track about it, and before he finds that it is the wrong track it will be in Holland and we out of the country. That sounds good to me! cried Sam Merton, with a grin. You go on and tell the Dutchman to get a move on him. I'll see this sucker and fill him up with a bogus confession. I'll tell him that the stone is in Liverpool. Confound that whining music; it gets on my nerves! By the time he finds it isn't in Liverpool it will be in quarters and we on the blue water. Come back here, out of a line with that keyhole. Here is the stone. I wonder you dare carry it. Where could I have it safer? If we could take it out of Whitehall someone else could surely take it out of my lodgings. Let's have a look at it. Count Sylvius cast a somewhat unflattering glance at his associate, and disregarded the unwashed hand which was extended towards him. What--d'ye think I'm going to snatch it off you? See here, mister, I'm getting a bit tired of your ways. Well, well; no offence, Sam. We can't afford to quarrel. Come over to the window if you want to see the beauty properly. Now hold it to the light! Here! Thank you! With a single spring Holmes had leaped from the dummy's chair and had grasped the precious jewel. He held it now in one hand, while his other pointed a revolver at the Count's head. The two villains staggered back in utter amazement. Before they had recovered Holmes had pressed the electric bell. No violence, gentlemen--no violence, I beg of you! Consider the furniture! It must be very clear to you that your position is an impossible one. The police are waiting below. The Count's bewilderment overmastered his rage and fear. But how the deuce----? he gasped. Your surprise is very natural. You are not aware that a second door from my bedroom leads behind that curtain. I fancied that you must have heard me when I displaced the figure, but luck was on my side. It gave me a chance of listening to your racy conversation which would have been painfully constrained had you been aware of my presence. The Count gave a gesture of resignation. We give you best, Holmes. I believe you are the devil himself. Not far from him, at any rate, Holmes answered, with a polite smile. Sam Merton's slow intellect had only gradually appreciated the situation. Now, as the sound of heavy steps came from the stairs outside, he broke silence at last. A fair cop! said he. But, I say, what about that bloomin' fiddle! I hear it yet. Tut, tut! Holmes answered. You are perfectly right. Let it play! These modern gramophones are a remarkable invention. There was an inrush of police, the handcuffs clicked and the criminals were led to the waiting cab. Watson lingered with Holmes, congratulating him upon this fresh leaf added to his laurels. Once more their conversation was interrupted by the imperturbable Billy with his card-tray. Lord Cantlemere, sir. Show him up, Billy. This is the eminent peer who represents the very highest interests, said Holmes. He is an excellent and loyal person, but rather of the old regime. Shall we make him unbend? Dare we venture upon a slight liberty? He knows, we may conjecture, nothing of what has occurred. The door opened to admit a thin, austere figure with a hatchet face and drooping mid-Victorian whiskers of a glossy blackness which hardly corresponded with the rounded shoulders and feeble gait. Holmes advanced affably, and shook an unresponsive hand. How-do-you-do, Lord Cantlemere? It is chilly, for the time of year, but rather warm indoors. May I take your overcoat? No, I thank you; I will not take it off. Holmes laid his hand insistently upon the sleeve. Pray allow me! My friend Dr. Watson would assure you that these changes of temperature are most insidious. His lordship shook himself free with some impatience. I am quite comfortable, sir. I have no need to stay. I have simply looked in to know how your self-appointed task was progressing. It is difficult--very difficult. I feared that you would find it so. There was a distinct sneer in the old courtier's words and manner. Every man finds his limitations, Mr. Holmes, but at least it cures us of the weakness of self-satisfaction. Yes, sir, I have been much perplexed. No doubt. Especially upon one point. Possibly you could help me upon it? You apply for my advice rather late in the day. I thought that you had your own all-sufficient methods. Still, I am ready to help you. You see, Lord Cantlemere, we can no doubt frame a case against the actual thieves. When you have caught them. Exactly. But the question is--how shall we proceed against the receiver? Is this not rather premature? It is as well to have our plans ready. Now, what would you regard as final evidence against the receiver? The actual possession of the stone. You would arrest him upon that? Most undoubtedly. Holmes seldom laughed, but he got as near it as his old friend Watson could remember. In that case, my dear sir, I shall be under the painful necessity of advising your arrest. Lord Cantlemere was very angry. Some of the ancient fires flickered up into his sallow cheeks. You take a great liberty, Mr. Holmes. In fifty years of official life I cannot recall such a case. I am a busy man, sir, engaged upon important affairs, and I have no time or taste for foolish jokes. I may tell you frankly, sir, that I have never been a believer in your powers, and that I have always been of the opinion that the matter was far safer in the hands of the regular police force. Your conduct confirms all my conclusions. I have the honour, sir, to wish you good evening. Holmes had swiftly changed his position and was between the peer and the door. One moment, sir, said he. To actually go off with the Mazarin stone would be a more serious offence than to be found in temporary possession of it. Sir, this is intolerable! Let me pass. Put your hand in the right-hand pocket of your overcoat. What do you mean, sir? Come--come; do what I ask. An instant later the amazed peer was standing, blinking and stammering, with the great yellow stone on his shaking palm. What! What! How is this, Mr. Holmes? Too bad, Lord Cantlemere, too bad! cried Holmes. My old friend here will tell you that I have an impish habit of practical joking. Also that I can never resist a dramatic situation. I took the liberty--the very great liberty, I admit--of putting the stone into your pocket at the beginning of our interview. The old peer stared from the stone to the smiling face before him. Sir, I am bewildered. But--yes--it is indeed the Mazarin stone. We are greatly your debtors, Mr. Holmes. Your sense of humour may, as you admit, be somewhat perverted, and its exhibition remarkably untimely, but at least I withdraw any reflection I have made upon your amazing professional powers. But how---- The case is but half finished; the details can wait. No doubt, Lord Cantlemere, your pleasure in telling of this successful result in the exalted circle to which you return will be some small atonement for my practical joke. Billy, you will show his lordship out, and tell Mrs. Hudson that I should be glad if she would send up dinner for two as soon as possible. IV THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE GABLES I don't think that any of my adventures with Mr. Sherlock Holmes opened quite so abruptly, or so dramatically, as that which I associate with The Three Gables. I had not seen Holmes for some days, and had no idea of the new channel into which his activities had been directed. He was in a chatty mood that morning, however, and had just settled me into the well-worn low arm-chair on one side of the fire, while he had curled down with his pipe in his mouth upon the opposite chair, when our visitor arrived. If I had said that a mad bull had arrived, it would give a clearer impression of what occurred. The door had flown open and a huge negro had burst into the room. He would have been a comic figure if he had not been terrific, for he was dressed in a very loud grey check suit with a flowing salmon-coloured tie. His broad face and flattened nose were thrust forward, as his sullen dark eyes, with a smouldering gleam of malice in them, turned from one of us to the other. Which of you genelmen is Masser Holmes? he asked. Holmes raised his pipe with a languid smile. Oh! it's you, is it? said our visitor, coming with an unpleasant, stealthy step round the angle of the table. See here, Masser Holmes, you keep your hands out of other folks' business. Leave folks to manage their own affairs. Got that, Masser Holmes? Keep on talking, said Holmes. It's fine. Oh! it's fine, is it? growled the savage. It won't be so damn fine if I have to trim you up a bit. I've handled your kind before now, and they didn't look fine when I was through with them. Look at that, Masser Holmes! He swung a huge knotted lump of a fist under my friend's nose. Holmes examined it closely with an air of great interest. Were you born so? he asked. Or did it come by degrees? It may have been the icy coolness of my friend, or it may have been the slight clatter which I made as I picked up the poker. In any case, our visitor's manner became less flamboyant. Well, I've given you fair warnin', said he. I've a friend that's interested out Harrow way--you know what I'm meaning--and he don't intend to have no buttin' in by you. Got that? You ain't the law, and I ain't the law either, and if you come in I'll be on hand also. Don't you forget it. I've wanted to meet you for some time, said Holmes. I won't ask you to sit down, for I don't like the smell of you, but aren't you Steve Dixie, the bruiser? That's my name, Masser Holmes, and you'll get put through it for sure if you give me any lip. It is certainly the last thing you need, said Holmes, staring at our visitor's hideous mouth. But it was the killing of young Perkins outside the Holborn Bar---- What! you're not going? The negro had sprung back, and his face was leaden. I won't listen to no such talk, said he. What have I to do with this 'ere Perkins, Masser Holmes? I was trainin' at the Bull Ring in Birmingham when this boy done gone get into trouble. Yes, you'll tell the magistrate about it, Steve, said Holmes. I've been watching you and Barney Stockdale---- So help me the Lord! Masser Holmes---- That's enough. Get out of it. I'll pick you up when I want you. Good mornin', Masser Holmes. I hope there ain't no hard feelin's about this 'ere visit? There will be unless you tell me who sent you. Why, there ain't no secret about that, Masser Holmes. It was that same genelman that you have just done gone mention. And who set him on to it? S'elp me. I don't know, Masser Holmes. He just say, 'Steve, you go see Mr. Holmes, and tell him his life ain't safe if he go down Harrow way.' That's the whole truth. Without waiting for any further questioning, our visitor bolted out of the room almost as precipitately as he had entered. Holmes knocked out the ashes of his pipe with a quiet chuckle. I am glad you were not forced to break his woolly head, Watson. I observed your manoeuvres with the poker. But he is really rather a harmless fellow, a great muscular, foolish, blustering baby, and easily cowed, as you have seen. He is one of the Spencer John gang and has taken part in some dirty work of late which I may clear up when I have time. His immediate principal, Barney, is a more astute person. They specialize in assaults, intimidation, and the like. What I want to know is, who is at the back of them on this particular occasion? But why do they want to intimidate you? It is this Harrow Weald case. It decides me to look into the matter, for if it is worth anyone's while to take so much trouble, there must be something in it. But what is it? I was going to tell you when we had this comic interlude. Here is Mrs. Maberley's note. If you care to come with me we will wire her and go out at once. DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES, (I read)-- I have had a succession of strange incidents occur to me in connection with this house, and I should much value your advice. You would find me at home any time to-morrow. The house is within a short walk of the Weald Station. I believe that my late husband, Mortimer Maberley, was one of your early clients. Yours faithfully, MARY MABERLEY. The address was The Three Gables, Harrow Weald. So that's that! said Holmes. And now, if you can spare the time, Watson, we will get upon our way. A short railway journey, and a shorter drive, brought us to the house, a brick and timber villa, standing in its own acre of undeveloped grassland. Three small projections above the upper windows made a feeble attempt to justify its name. Behind was a grove of melancholy, half-grown pines, and the whole aspect of the place was poor and depressing. None the less, we found the house to be well furnished, and the lady who received us was a most engaging elderly person, who bore every mark of refinement and culture. I remember your husband well, madam, said Holmes, though it is some years since he used my services in some trifling matter. Probably you would be more familiar with the name of my son Douglas. Holmes looked at her with great interest. Dear me! Are you the mother of Douglas Maberley? I knew him slightly. But, of course, all London knew him. What a magnificent creature he was! Where is he now? Dead, Mr. Holmes, dead! He was Attaché at Rome, and he died there of pneumonia last month. I am sorry. One could not connect death with such a man. I have never known anyone so vitally alive. He lived intensely--every fibre of him! Too intensely, Mr. Holmes. That was the ruin of him. You remember him as he was--debonair and splendid. You did not see the moody, morose, brooding creature into which he developed. His heart was broken. In a single month I seemed to see my gallant boy turn into a worn-out cynical man. A love affair--a woman? Or a fiend. Well, it was not to talk of my poor lad that I asked you to come, Mr. Holmes. Dr. Watson and I are at your service. There have been some very strange happenings. I have been in this house more than a year now, and as I wished to lead a retired life I have seen little of my neighbours. Three days ago I had a call from a man who said that he was a house agent. He said that this house would exactly suit a client of his and that if I would part with it money would be no object. It seemed to me very strange, as there are several empty houses on the market which appear to be equally eligible, but naturally I was interested in what he said. I therefore named a price which was five hundred pounds more than I gave. He at once closed with the offer, but added that his client desired to buy the furniture as well and would I put a price upon it. Some of this furniture is from my old home, and it is, as you see, very good, so that I named a good round sum. To this also he at once agreed. I had always wanted to travel, and the bargain was so good a one that it really seemed that I should be my own mistress for the rest of my life. Yesterday the man arrived with the agreement all drawn out. Luckily I showed it to Mr. Sutro, my lawyer, who lives in Harrow. He said to me, 'This is a very strange document. Are you aware that if you sign it you could not legally take _anything_ out of the house--not even your own private possessions?' When the man came again in the evening I pointed this out, and I said that I meant only to sell the furniture. 'No, no; everything,' said he. 'But my clothes? My jewels?' 'Well, well, some concession might be made for your personal effects. But nothing shall go out of the house unchecked. My client is a very liberal man, but he has his fads and his own way of doing things. It is everything or nothing with him.' 'Then it must be nothing,' said I. And there the matter was left, but the whole thing seemed to me to be so unusual that I thought---- Here we had a very extraordinary interruption. Holmes raised his hand for silence. Then he strode across the room, flung open the door, and dragged in a great gaunt woman whom he had seized by the shoulder. She entered with ungainly struggles, like some huge awkward chicken, torn squawking out of its coop. Leave me alone! What are you a-doin' of? she screeched. Why, Susan, what is this? Well, ma'am, I was comin' in to ask if the visitors was stayin' for lunch when this man jumped out at me. I have been listening to her for the last five minutes, but did not wish to interrupt your most interesting narrative. Just a little wheezy, Susan, are you not? You breathe too heavily for that kind of work. Susan turned a sulky but amazed face upon her captor. Who be you, anyhow, and what right have you a-pullin' me about like this? It was merely that I wished to ask a question in your presence. Did you, Mrs. Maberley, mention to anyone that you were going to write to me and consult me? No, Mr. Holmes, I did not. Who posted your letter? Susan did. Exactly. Now, Susan, to whom was it that you wrote or sent a message to say that your mistress was asking advice from me? It's a lie. I sent no message. Now, Susan, wheezy people may not live long, you know. It's a wicked thing to tell fibs. Whom did you tell? Susan! cried her mistress, I believe you are a bad, treacherous woman. I remember now that I saw you speaking to someone over the hedge. That was my own business, said the woman sullenly. Suppose I tell you that it was Barney Stockdale to whom you spoke? said Holmes. Well, if you know, what do you want to ask for? I was not sure, but I know now. Well now, Susan, it will be worth ten pounds to you if you will tell me who is at the back of Barney. Someone that could lay down a thousand pounds for every ten you have in the world. So, a rich man? No; you smiled--a rich woman. Now we have got so far, you may as well give the name and earn the tenner. I'll see you in hell first. Oh, Susan! Language! I am clearing out of here. I've had enough of you all. I'll send for my box to-morrow. She flounced for the door. Good-bye, Susan. Paregoric is the stuff.... Now, he continued, turning suddenly from lively to severe when the door had closed behind the flushed and angry woman, this gang means business. Look how close they play the game. Your letter to me had the 10 p.m. postmark. And yet Susan passes the word to Barney. Barney has time to go to his employer and get instructions; he or she--I incline to the latter from Susan's grin when she thought I had blundered--forms a plan. Black Steve is called in, and I am warned off by eleven o'clock next morning. That's quick work, you know. But what do they want? Yes, that's the question. Who had the house before you? A retired sea captain, called Ferguson. Anything remarkable about him? Not that ever I heard of. I was wondering whether he could have buried something. Of course, when people bury treasure nowadays they do it in the Post Office bank. But there are always some lunatics about. It would be a dull world without them. At first I thought of some buried valuable. But why, in that case, should they want your furniture? You don't happen to have a Raphael or a first folio Shakespeare without knowing it? No, I don't think I have anything rarer than a Crown Derby tea-set. That would hardly justify all this mystery. Besides, why should they not openly state what they want? If they covet your tea-set, they can surely offer a price for it without buying you out, lock, stock, and barrel. No, as I read it, there is something which you do not know that you have, and which you would not give up if you did know. That is how I read it, said I. Dr. Watson agrees, so that settles it. Well, Mr. Holmes, what can it be? Let us see whether by this purely mental analysis we can get it to a finer point. You have been in this house a year. Nearly two. All the better. During this long period no one wants anything from you. Now suddenly within three or four days you have urgent demands. What would you gather from that? It can only mean, said I, that the object, whatever it may be, has only just come into the house. Settled once again, said Holmes. Now, Mrs. Maberley, has any object just arrived? No; I have bought nothing new this year. Indeed! That is very remarkable. Well, I think we had best let matters develop a little further until we have clearer data. Is that lawyer of yours a capable man? Mr. Sutro is most capable. Have you another maid, or was the fair Susan, who has just banged your front door, alone? I have a young girl. Try and get Sutro to spend a night or two in the house. You might possibly want protection. Against whom? Who knows? The matter is certainly obscure. If I can't find what they are after, I must approach the matter from the other end, and try to get at the principal. Did this house-agent man give any address? Simply his card and occupation. Haines-Johnson, Auctioneer and Valuer. I don't think we shall find him in the Directory. Honest business men don't conceal their place of business. Well, you will let me know any fresh development. I have taken up your case, and you may rely upon it that I shall see it through. As we passed through the hall Holmes's eyes, which missed nothing, lighted upon several trunks and cases which were piled in the corner. The labels shone out upon them. 'Milano.' 'Lucerne.' These are from Italy. They are poor Douglas's things. You have not unpacked them? How long have you had them? They arrived last week. But you said--why, surely this might be the missing link. How do we know that there is not something of value there? There could not possibly be, Mr. Holmes. Poor Douglas had only his pay and a small annuity. What could he have of value? Holmes was lost in thought. Delay no longer, Mrs. Maberley, he said at last. Have these things taken upstairs to your bedroom. Examine them as soon as possible and see what they contain. I will come to-morrow and hear your report. It was quite evident that The Three Gables was under very close surveillance, for as we came round the high hedge at the end of the lane there was the negro prize-fighter standing in the shadow. We came on him quite suddenly, and a grim and menacing figure he looked in that lonely place. Holmes clapped his hand to his pocket. Lookin' for your gun, Masser Holmes? No; for my scent-bottle, Steve. You are funny, Masser Holmes, ain't you? It won't be funny for you, Steve, if I get after you. I gave you fair warning this morning. Well, Masser Holmes, I done gone think over what you said, and I don't want no more talk about that affair of Masser Perkins. S'pose I can help you, Masser Holmes, I will. Well, then, tell me who is behind you on this job? So help me the Lord! Masser Holmes, I told you the truth before. I don't know. My boss Barney gives me orders and that's all. Well, just bear in mind, Steve, that the lady in that house, and everything under that roof, is under my protection. Don't you forget it. All right, Masser Holmes. I'll remember.' I've got him thoroughly frightened for his own skin, Watson, Holmes remarked as we walked on. I think he would double-cross his employer if he knew who he was. It was lucky I had some knowledge of the Spencer John crowd, and that Steve was one of them. Now, Watson, this is a case for Langdale Pike, and I am going to see him now. When I get back I may be clearer in the matter. I saw no more of Holmes during the day, but I could well imagine how he spent it, for Langdale Pike was his human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal. This strange, languid creature spent his waking hours in the bow window of a St. James's Street club, and was the receiving-station, as well as the transmitter, for all the gossip of the Metropolis. He made, it was said, a four-figure income by the paragraphs which he contributed every week to the garbage papers which cater for an inquisitive public. If ever, far down in the turbid depths of London life, there was some strange swirl or eddy, it was marked with automatic exactness by this human dial upon the surface. Holmes discreetly helped Langdale to knowledge, and on occasion was helped in turn. When I met my friend in his room early next morning, I was conscious from his bearing that all was well, but none the less a most unpleasant surprise was awaiting us. It took the shape of the following telegram: Please come out at once. Client's house burgled in the night. Police in possession. SUTRO. Holmes whistled. The drama has come to a crisis, and quicker than I had expected. There is a great driving-power at the back of this business, Watson, which does not surprise me after what I have heard. This Sutro, of course, is her lawyer. I made a mistake, I fear, in not asking you to spend the night on guard. This fellow has clearly proved a broken reed. Well, there is nothing for it but another journey to Harrow Weald. We found The Three Gables a very different establishment to the orderly household of the previous day. A small group of idlers had assembled at the garden gate, while a couple of constables were examining the windows and the geranium beds. Within we met a grey old gentleman, who introduced himself as the lawyer, together with a bustling, rubicund Inspector, who greeted Holmes as an old friend. Well, Mr. Holmes, no chance for you in this case, I'm afraid. Just a common, ordinary burglary, and well within the capacity of the poor old police. No experts need apply. I am sure the case is in very good hands, said Holmes. Merely a common burglary, you say? Quite so. We know pretty well who the men are and where to find them. It is that gang of Barney Stockdale, with the big nigger in it--they've been seen about here. Excellent! What did they get? Well, they don't seem to have got much. Mrs. Maberley was chloroformed and the house was---- Ah! here is the lady herself. Our friend of yesterday, looking very pale and ill, had entered the room, leaning upon a little maid-servant. You gave me good advice, Mr. Holmes, said she, smiling ruefully. Alas, I did not take it! I did not wish to trouble Mr. Sutro, and so I was unprotected. I only heard of it this morning, the lawyer explained. Mr. Holmes advised me to have some friend in the house. I neglected his advice, and I have paid for it. You look wretchedly ill, said Holmes. Perhaps you are hardly equal to telling me what occurred. It is all here, said the Inspector, tapping a bulky notebook. Still, if the lady is not too exhausted---- There is really so little to tell. I have no doubt that wicked Susan had planned an entrance for them. They must have known the house to an inch. I was conscious for a moment of the chloroform rag which was thrust over my mouth, but I have no notion how long I may have been senseless. When I woke, one man was at the bedside and another was rising with a bundle in his hand from among my son's baggage, which was partially opened and littered over the floor. Before he could get away I sprang up and seized him. You took a big risk, said the Inspector. I clung to him, but he shook me off, and the other may have struck me, for I can remember no more. Mary the maid heard the noise and began screaming out of the window. That brought the police, but the rascals had got away. What did they take? Well, I don't think there is anything of value missing. I am sure there was nothing in my son's trunks. Did the men leave no clue? There was one sheet of paper which I may have torn from the man that I grasped. It was lying all crumpled on the floor. It is in my son's handwriting. Which means that it is not of much use, said the Inspector. Now if it had been in the burglar's---- Exactly, said Holmes. What rugged common sense! None the less, I should be curious to see it. The Inspector drew a folded sheet of foolscap from his pocket-book. I never pass anything, however trifling, said he, with some pomposity. That is my advice to you, Mr. Holmes. In twenty-five years' experience I have learned my lesson. There is always the chance of finger-marks or something. Holmes inspected the sheet of paper. What do you make of it, Inspector? Seems to be the end of some queer novel, so far as I can see. It may certainly prove to be the end of a queer tale, said Holmes. You have noticed the number on the top of the page. It is two hundred and forty-five. Where are the odd two hundred and forty-four pages? Well, I suppose the burglars got those. Much good may it do them! It seems a queer thing to break into a house in order to steal such papers as that. Does it suggest anything to you, Inspector? Yes, sir; it suggests that in their hurry the rascals just grabbed at what came first to hand. I wish them joy of what they got. Why should they go to my son's things? asked Mrs. Maberley. Well, they found nothing valuable downstairs, so they tried their luck upstairs. That is how I read it. What do you make of it, Mr. Holmes? I must think it over, Inspector. Come to the window, Watson. Then, as we stood together, he read over the fragment of paper. It began in the middle of a sentence and ran like this: ... face bled considerably from the cuts and blows, but it was nothing to the bleeding of his heart as he saw that lovely face, the face for which he had been prepared to sacrifice his very life, looking out at his agony and humiliation. She smiled--yes, by Heaven! she smiled, like the heartless fiend she was, as he looked up at her. It was at that moment that love died and hate was born. Man must live for something. If it is not for your embrace, my lady, then it shall surely be for your undoing and my complete revenge. Queer grammar! said Holmes, with a smile, as he handed the paper back to the Inspector. Did you notice how the 'he' suddenly changed to 'my.' The writer was so carried away by his own story that he imagined himself at the supreme moment to be the hero. It seemed mighty poor stuff, said the Inspector, as he replaced it in his book. What! are you off, Mr. Holmes? I don't think there is anything more for me to do now that the case is in such capable hands. By the way, Mrs. Maberley, did you say you wished to travel? It has always been my dream, Mr. Holmes. Where would you like to go--Cairo, Madeira, the Riviera? Oh! if I had the money I would go round the world. Quite so. Round the world. Well, good morning. I may drop you a line in the evening. As we passed the window I caught a glimpse of the Inspector's smile and shake of the head. These clever fellows have always a touch of madness. That was what I read in the Inspector's smile. Now, Watson, we are at the last lap of our little journey, said Holmes, when we were back in the roar of Central London once more. I think we had best clear the matter up at once, and it would be well that you should come with me, for it is safer to have a witness when you are dealing with such a lady as Isadora Klein. We had taken a cab and were speeding to some address in Grosvenor Square. Holmes had been sunk in thought, but he roused himself suddenly. By the way, Watson, I suppose you see it all clearly? No, I can't say that I do. I only gather that we are going to see the lady who is behind all this mischief. Exactly! But does the name Isadora Klein convey nothing to you? She was, of course, the celebrated beauty. There was never a woman to touch her. She is pure Spanish, the real blood of the masterful Conquistadors, and her people have been leaders in Pernambuco for generations. She married the aged German sugar king, Klein, and presently found herself the richest as well as the most lovely widow upon earth. Then there was an interval of adventure when she pleased her own tastes. She had several lovers, and Douglas Maberley, one of the most striking men in London, was one of them. It was by all accounts more than an adventure with him. He was not a Society butterfly, but a strong, proud man who gave and expected all. But she is the '_belle dame sans merci_' of fiction. When her caprice is satisfied, the matter is ended, and if the other party in the matter can't take her word for it, she knows how to bring it home to him. Then that was his own story---- Ah! you are piecing it together now. I hear that she is about to marry the young Duke of Lomond, who might almost be her son. His Grace's ma might overlook the age, but a big scandal would be a different matter, so it is imperative---- Ah! here we are. It was one of the finest corner-houses of the West End. A machine-like footman took up our cards and returned with word that the lady was not at home. Then we shall wait until she is, said Holmes cheerfully. The machine broke down. Not at home means not at home to _you_, said the footman. Good, Holmes answered. That means that we shall not have to wait. Kindly give this note to your mistress. He scribbled three or four words upon a sheet of his notebook, folded it, and handed it to the man. What did you say, Holmes? I asked. I simply wrote 'Shall it be the police, then?' I think that should pass us in. It did--with amazing celerity. A minute later we were in an Arabian-nights' drawing-room, vast and wonderful, in a half gloom, picked out with an occasional pink electric light. The lady had come, I felt, to that time of life when even the proudest beauty finds the half-light more welcome. She rose from a settee as we entered: tall, queenly, a perfect figure, a lovely mask-like face, with two wonderful Spanish eyes which looked murder at us both. What is this intrusion--and this insulting message? she asked, holding up the slip of paper. I need not explain, madame. I have too much respect for your intelligence to do so--though I confess that intelligence has been surprisingly at fault of late. How so, sir? By supposing that your hired bullies could frighten me from my work. Surely no man would take up my profession if it were not that danger attracts him. It was you, then, who forced me to examine the case of young Maberley. I have no idea what you are talking about. What have I to do with hired bullies? Holmes turned away wearily. Yes, I have underrated your intelligence. Well, good afternoon! Stop! Where are you going? To Scotland Yard. We had not got half-way to the door before she had overtaken us and was holding his arm. She had turned in a moment from steel to velvet. Come and sit down, gentlemen. Let us talk this matter over. I feel that I may be frank with you, Mr. Holmes. You have the feelings of a gentleman. How quick a woman's instinct is to find it out. I will treat you as a friend. I cannot promise to reciprocate, madame. I am not the law, but I represent justice so far as my feeble powers go. I am ready to listen, and then I will tell you how I will act. No doubt it was foolish of me to threaten a brave man like yourself. What was really foolish, madame, is that you have placed yourself in the power of a band of rascals who may blackmail or give you away. No, no! I am not so simple. Since I have promised to be frank, I may say that no one, save Barney Stockdale and Susan, his wife, have the least idea who their employer is. As to them, well, it is not the first---- She smiled and nodded, with a charming coquettish intimacy. I see. You've tested them before. They are good hounds who run silent. Such hounds have a way sooner or later of biting the hand that feeds them. They will be arrested for this burglary. The police are already after them. They will take what comes to them. That is what they are paid for. I shall not appear in the matter. Unless I bring you into it. No, no; you would not. You are a gentleman. It is a woman's secret. In the first place you must give back this manuscript. She broke into a ripple of laughter, and walked to the fireplace. There was a calcined mass which she broke up with the poker. Shall I give this back? she asked. So roguish and exquisite did she look as she stood before us with a challenging smile that I felt of all Holmes's criminals this was the one whom he would find it hardest to face. However, he was immune from sentiment. That seals your fate, he said coldly. You are very prompt in your actions, madame, but you have overdone it on this occasion. She threw the poker down with a clatter. How hard you are! she cried. May I tell you the whole story? I fancy I could tell it to you. But you must look at it with my eyes, Mr. Holmes. You must realize it from the point of view of a woman who sees all her life's ambition about to be ruined at the last moment. Is such a woman to be blamed if she protects herself? The original sin was yours. Yes, yes! I admit it. He was a dear boy, Douglas, but it so chanced that he could not fit into my plans. He wanted marriage--marriage, Mr. Holmes--with a penniless commoner. Nothing less would serve him. Then he became pertinacious. Because I had given he seemed to think that I still must give, and to him only. It was intolerable. At last I had to make him realize it. By hiring ruffians to beat him under your own window. You do indeed seem to know everything. Well, it is true. Barney and the boys drove him away, and were, I admit, a little rough in doing so. But what did he do then? Could I have believed that a gentleman would do such an act? He wrote a book in which he described his own story. I, of course, was the wolf; he the lamb. It was all there, under different names, of course; but who in all London would have failed to recognize it? What do you say to that, Mr. Holmes? Well, he was within his rights. It was as if the air of Italy had got into his blood and brought with it the old cruel Italian spirit. He wrote to me and sent me a copy of his book that I might have the torture of anticipation. There were two copies, he said--one for me, one for his publisher. How did you know the publisher's had not reached him? I knew who his publisher was. It is not his only novel, you know. I found out that he had not heard from Italy. Then came Douglas's sudden death. So long as that other manuscript was in the world there was no safety for me. Of course, it must be among his effects, and these would be returned to his mother. I set the gang at work. One of them got into the house as servant. I wanted to do the thing honestly. I really and truly did. I was ready to buy the house and everything in it. I offered any price she cared to ask. I only tried the other way when everything else had failed. Now, Mr. Holmes, granting that I was too hard on Douglas--and, God knows, I am sorry for it!--what else could I do with my whole future at stake? Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders. Well, well, said he, I suppose I shall have to compound a felony as usual. How much does it cost to go round the world in first-class style? The lady stared in amazement. Could it be done on five thousand pounds? Well, I should think so, indeed! Very good. I think you will sign me a cheque for that, and I will see that it comes to Mrs. Maberley. You owe her a little change of air. Meantime, lady--he wagged a cautionary forefinger--have a care! Have a care! You can't play with edged tools for ever without cutting those dainty hands. V THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE Holmes had read carefully a note which the last post had brought him. Then, with the dry chuckle which was his nearest approach to a laugh, he tossed it over to me. For a mixture of the modern and the mediæval, of the practical and of the wildly fanciful, I think this is surely the limit, said he. What do you make of it, Watson? I read as follows: 46, OLD JEWRY, _Nov._ 19_th._ _Re_ Vampires. SIR,-- Our client, Mr. Robert Ferguson, of Ferguson and Muirhead, tea brokers, of Mincing Lane, has made some inquiry from us in a communication of even date concerning vampires. As our firm specializes entirely upon the assessment of machinery the matter hardly comes within our purview, and we have therefore recommended Mr. Ferguson to call upon you and lay the matter before you. We have not forgotten your successful action in the case of Matilda Briggs. We are, Sir, Faithfully yours, MORRISON, MORRISON, AND DODD. per E. J. C. Matilda Briggs was not the name of a young woman, Watson, said Holmes, in a reminiscent voice. It was a ship which is associated with the giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet prepared. But what do we know about vampires? Does it come within our purview either? Anything is better than stagnation, but really we seem to have been switched on to a Grimm's fairy tale. Make a long arm, Watson, and see what V has to say. I leaned back and took down the great index volume to which he referred. Holmes balanced it on his knee and his eyes moved slowly and lovingly over the record of old cases, mixed with the accumulated information of a lifetime. Voyage of the Gloria Scott, he read. That was a bad business. I have some recollection that you made a record of it, Watson, though I was unable to congratulate you upon the result. Victor Lynch, the forger. Venomous lizard or gila. Remarkable case, that! Vittoria, the circus belle. Vanderbilt and the Yeggman. Vipers. Vigor, the Hammersmith wonder. Hullo! Hullo! Good old index. You can't beat it. Listen to this, Watson. Vampirism in Hungary. And again, Vampires in Transylvania. He turned over the pages with eagerness, but after a short intent perusal he threw down the great book with a snarl of disappointment. Rubbish, Watson, rubbish! What have we to do with walking corpses who can only be held in their grave by stakes driven through their hearts? It's pure lunacy. But surely, said I, the vampire was not necessarily a dead man? A living person might have the habit. I have read, for example, of the old sucking the blood of the young in order to retain their youth. You are right, Watson. It mentions the legend in one of these references. But are we to give serious attention to such things? This Agency stands flat-footed upon the ground, and there it must remain. The world is big enough for us. No ghosts need apply. I fear that we cannot take Mr. Robert Ferguson very seriously. Possibly this note may be from him, and may throw some light upon what is worrying him. He took up a second letter which had lain unnoticed upon the table whilst he had been absorbed with the first. This he began to read with a smile of amusement upon his face which gradually faded away into an expression of intense interest and concentration. When he had finished he sat for some little time lost in thought with the letter dangling from his fingers. Finally, with a start, he aroused himself from his reverie. Cheeseman's, Lamberley. Where is Lamberley, Watson? It is in Sussex, south of Horsham. Not very far, eh? And Cheeseman's? I know that country, Holmes. It is full of old houses which are named after the men who built them centuries ago. You get Odley's and Harvey's and Carriton's--the folk are forgotten but their names live in their houses. Precisely, said Holmes coldly. It was one of the peculiarities of his proud, self-contained nature that, though he docketed any fresh information very quickly and accurately in his brain, he seldom made any acknowledgment to the giver. I rather fancy we shall know a good deal more about Cheeseman's, Lamberley, before we are through. The letter is, as I had hoped, from Robert Ferguson. By the way, he claims acquaintance with you. With me! You had better read it. He handed the letter across. It was headed with the address quoted. DEAR MR. HOLMES, (it said)--I have been recommended to you by my lawyers, but indeed the matter is so extraordinarily delicate that it is most difficult to discuss. It concerns a friend for whom I am acting. This gentleman married some five years ago a Peruvian lady, the daughter of a Peruvian merchant, whom he had met in connection with the importation of nitrates. The lady was very beautiful, but the fact of her foreign birth and of her alien religion always caused a separation of interests and of feelings between husband and wife, so that after a time his love may have cooled towards her and he may have come to regard their union as a mistake. He felt there were sides of her character which he could never explore or understand. This was the more painful as she was as loving a wife as a man could have--to all appearance absolutely devoted. Now for the point which I will make more plain when we meet. Indeed, this note is merely to give you a general idea of the situation and to ascertain whether you would care to interest yourself in the matter. The lady began to show some curious traits quite alien to her ordinarily sweet and gentle disposition. The gentleman had been married twice and he had one son by the first wife. This boy was now fifteen, a very charming and affectionate youth, though unhappily injured through an accident in childhood. Twice the wife was caught in the act of assaulting this poor lad in the most unprovoked way. Once she struck him with a stick and left a great weal on his arm. This was a small matter, however, compared with her conduct to her own child, a dear boy just under one year of age. On one occasion about a month ago this child had been left by its nurse for a few minutes. A loud cry from the baby, as of pain, called the nurse back. As she ran into the room she saw her employer, the lady, leaning over the baby and apparently biting his neck. There was a small wound in the neck, from which a stream of blood had escaped. The nurse was so horrified that she wished to call the husband, but the lady implored her not to do so, and actually gave her five pounds as a price for her silence. No explanation was ever given, and for the moment the matter was passed over. It left, however, a terrible impression upon the nurse's mind, and from that time she began to watch her mistress closely, and to keep a closer guard upon the baby, whom she tenderly loved. It seemed to her that even as she watched the mother, so the mother watched her, and that every time she was compelled to leave the baby alone the mother was waiting to get at it. Day and night the nurse covered the child, and day and night the silent, watchful mother seemed to be lying in wait as a wolf waits for a lamb. It must read most incredible to you, and yet I beg you to take it seriously, for a child's life and a man's sanity may depend upon it. At last there came one dreadful day when the facts could no longer be concealed from the husband. The nurse's nerve had given way; she could stand the strain no longer, and she made a clean breast of it all to the man. To him it seemed as wild a tale as it may now seem to you. He knew his wife to be a loving wife, and, save for the assaults upon her stepson, a loving mother. Why, then, should she wound her own dear little baby? He told the nurse that she was dreaming, that her suspicions were those of a lunatic, and that such libels upon her mistress were not to be tolerated. Whilst they were talking, a sudden cry of pain was heard. Nurse and master rushed together to the nursery. Imagine his feelings, Mr. Holmes, as he saw his wife rise from a kneeling position beside the cot, and saw blood upon the child's exposed neck and upon the sheet. With a cry of horror, he turned his wife's face to the light and saw blood all round her lips. It was she--she beyond all question--who had drunk the poor baby's blood. So the matter stands. She is now confined to her room. There has been no explanation. The husband is half demented. He knows, and I know, little of Vampirism beyond the name. We had thought it was some wild tale of foreign parts. And yet here in the very heart of the English Sussex--well, all this can be discussed with you in the morning. Will you see me? Will you use your great powers in aiding a distracted man? If so, kindly wire to Ferguson, Cheeseman's, Lamberley, and I will be at your rooms by ten o'clock. Yours faithfully, ROBERT FERGUSON. PS.--I believe your friend Watson played Rugby for Blackheath when I was three-quarter for Richmond. It is the only personal introduction which I can give. Of course I remember him, said I, as I laid down the letter. Big Bob Ferguson, the finest three-quarter Richmond ever had. He was always a good-natured chap. It's like him to be so concerned over a friend's case. Holmes looked at me thoughtfully and shook his head. I never get your limits, Watson, said he. There are unexplored possibilities about you. Take a wire down, like a good fellow. 'Will examine your case with pleasure.' _Your_ case! We must not let him think that this Agency is a home for the weak-minded. Of course it is his case. Send him that wire and let the matter rest till morning. Promptly at ten o'clock next morning Ferguson strode into our room. I had remembered him as a long, slab-sided man with loose limbs and a fine turn of speed, which had carried him round many an opposing back. There is surely nothing in life more painful than to meet the wreck of a fine athlete whom one has known in his prime. His great frame had fallen in, his flaxen hair was scanty, and his shoulders were bowed. I fear that I roused corresponding emotions in him. Hullo, Watson, said he, and his voice was still deep and hearty. You don't look quite the man you did when I threw you over the ropes into the crowd at the Old Deer Park. I expect I have changed a bit also. But it's this last day or two that has aged me. I see by your telegram, Mr. Holmes, that it is no use my pretending to be anyone's deputy. It is simpler to deal direct, said Holmes. Of course it is. But you can imagine how difficult it is when you are speaking of the one woman whom you are bound to protect and help. What can I do? How am I to go to the police with such a story? And yet the kiddies have got to be protected. Is it madness, Mr. Holmes? Is it something in the blood? Have you any similar case in your experience? For God's sake, give me some advice, for I am at my wits' end. Very naturally, Mr. Ferguson. Now sit here and pull yourself together and give me a few clear answers. I can assure you that I am very far from being at my wits' end, and that I am confident we shall find some solution. First of all, tell me what steps you have taken. Is your wife still near the children? We had a dreadful scene. She is a most loving woman, Mr. Holmes. If ever a woman loved a man with all her heart and soul, she loves me. She was cut to the heart that I should have discovered this horrible, this incredible, secret. She would not even speak. She gave no answer to my reproaches, save to gaze at me with a sort of wild, despairing look in her eyes. Then she rushed to her room and locked herself in. Since then she has refused to see me. She has a maid who was with her before her marriage, Dolores by name--a friend rather than a servant. She takes her food to her. Then the child is in no immediate danger? Mrs. Mason, the nurse, has sworn that she will not leave it night or day. I can absolutely trust her. I am more uneasy about poor little Jack, for, as I told you in my note, he has twice been assaulted by her. But never wounded? No; she struck him savagely. It is the more terrible as he is a poor little inoffensive cripple. Ferguson's gaunt features softened as he spoke of his boy. You would think that the dear lad's condition would soften anyone's heart. A fall in childhood and a twisted spine, Mr. Holmes. But the dearest, most loving heart within. Holmes had picked up the letter of yesterday and was reading it over. What other inmates are there in your house, Mr. Ferguson? Two servants who have not been long with us. One stable-hand, Michael, who sleeps in the house. My wife, myself, my boy Jack, baby, Dolores, and Mrs. Mason. That is all. I gather that you did not know your wife well at the time of your marriage? I had only known her a few weeks. How long had this maid Dolores been with her? Some years. Then your wife's character would really be better known by Dolores than by you? Yes, you may say so. Holmes made a note. I fancy, said he, that I may be of more use at Lamberley than here. It is eminently a case for personal investigation. If the lady remains in her room, our presence could not annoy or inconvenience her. Of course, we would stay at the inn. Ferguson gave a gesture of relief. It is what I hoped, Mr. Holmes. There is an excellent train at two from Victoria, if you could come. Of course we could come. There is a lull at present. I can give you my undivided energies. Watson, of course, comes with us. But there are one or two points upon which I wish to be very sure before I start. This unhappy lady, as I understand it, has appeared to assault both the children, her own baby and your little son? That is so. But the assaults take different forms, do they not? She has beaten your son. Once with a stick and once very savagely with her hands. Did she give no explanation why she struck him? None, save that she hated him. Again and again she said so. Well, that is not unknown among stepmothers. A posthumous jealousy, we will say. Is the lady jealous by nature? Yes, she is very jealous--jealous with all the strength of her fiery tropical love. But the boy--he is fifteen, I understand, and probably very developed in mind, since his body has been circumscribed in action. Did he give you no explanation of these assaults? No; he declared there was no reason. Were they good friends at other times? No; there was never any love between them. Yet you say he is affectionate? Never in the world could there be so devoted a son. My life is his life. He is absorbed in what I say or do. Once again Holmes made a note. For some time he sat lost in thought. No doubt you and the boy were great comrades before this second marriage. You were thrown very close together, were you not? Very much so. And the boy, having so affectionate a nature, was devoted, no doubt, to the memory of his mother? Most devoted. He would certainly seem to be a most interesting lad. There is one other point about these assaults. Were the strange attacks upon the baby and the assaults upon your son at the same period? In the first case it was so. It was as if some frenzy had seized her, and she had vented her rage upon both. In the second case it was only Jack who suffered. Mrs. Mason had no complaint to make about the baby. That certainly complicates matters. I don't quite follow you, Mr. Holmes. Possibly not. One forms provisional theories and waits for time or fuller knowledge to explode them. A bad habit, Mr. Ferguson; but human nature is weak. I fear that your old friend here has given an exaggerated view of my scientific methods. However, I will only say at the present stage that your problem does not appear to me to be insoluble, and that you may expect to find us at Victoria at two o'clock. It was evening of a dull, foggy November day when, having left our bags at the Chequers, Lamberley, we drove through the Sussex clay of a long winding lane, and finally reached the isolated and ancient farm-house in which Ferguson dwelt. It was a large, straggling building, very old in the centre, very new at the wings, with towering Tudor chimneys and a lichen-spotted, high-pitched roof of Horsham slabs. The doorsteps were worn into curves, and the ancient tiles which lined the porch were marked with the rebus of a cheese and a man, after the original builder. Within, the ceilings were corrugated with heavy oaken beams, and the uneven floors sagged into sharp curves. An odour of age and decay pervaded the whole crumbling building. There was one very large central room, into which Ferguson led us. Here, in a huge old-fashioned fireplace with an iron screen behind it dated 1670, there blazed and spluttered a splendid log fire. The room, as I gazed round, was a most singular mixture of dates and of places. The half-panelled walls may well have belonged to the original yeoman farmer of the seventeenth century. They were ornamented, however, on the lower part by a line of well-chosen modern water-colours; while above, where yellow plaster took the place of oak, there was hung a fine collection of South American utensils and weapons, which had been brought, no doubt, by the Peruvian lady upstairs. Holmes rose, with that quick curiosity which sprang from his eager mind, and examined them with some care. He returned with his eyes full of thought. Hullo! he cried. Hullo! A spaniel had lain in a basket in the corner. It came slowly forward towards its master, walking with difficulty. Its hind-legs moved irregularly and its tail was on the ground. It licked Ferguson's hand. What is it, Mr. Holmes? The dog. What's the matter with it? That's what puzzled the vet. A sort of paralysis. Spinal meningitis, he thought. But it is passing. He'll be all right soon--won't you, Carlo? A shiver of assent passed through the drooping tail. The dog's mournful eyes passed from one of us to the other. He knew that we were discussing his case. Did it come on suddenly? In a single night. How long ago? It may have been four months ago. Very remarkable. Very suggestive. What do you see in it, Mr. Holmes? A confirmation of what I had already thought. For God's sake, what do you think, Mr. Holmes? It may be a mere intellectual puzzle to you, but it is life and death to me! My wife a would-be murderer--my child in constant danger! Don't play with me, Mr. Holmes. It is too terribly serious. The big Rugby three-quarter was trembling all over. Holmes put his hand soothingly upon his arm. I fear that there is pain for you, Mr. Ferguson, whatever the solution may be, said he. I would spare you all I can. I cannot say more for the instant, but before I leave this house I hope I may have something definite. Please God you may! If you will excuse me, gentlemen, I will go up to my wife's room and see if there has been any change. He was away some minutes, during which Holmes resumed his examination of the curiosities upon the wall. When our host returned it was clear from his downcast face that he had made no progress. He brought with him a tall, slim, brown-faced girl. The tea is ready, Dolores, said Ferguson. See that your mistress has everything she can wish. She verra ill, cried the girl, looking with indignant eyes at her master. She no ask for food. She verra ill. She need doctor. I frightened stay alone with her without doctor. Ferguson looked at me with a question in his eyes. I should be so glad if I could be of use. Would your mistress see Dr. Watson? I take him. I no ask leave. She needs doctor. Then I'll come with you at once. I followed the girl, who was quivering with strong emotion, up the staircase and down an ancient corridor. At the end was an iron-clamped and massive door. It struck me as I looked at it that if Ferguson tried to force his way to his wife he would find it no easy matter. The girl drew a key from her pocket, and the heavy oaken planks creaked upon their old hinges. I passed in and she swiftly followed, fastening the door behind her. On the bed a woman was lying who was clearly in a high fever. She was only half conscious, but as I entered she raised a pair of frightened but beautiful eyes and glared at me in apprehension. Seeing a stranger, she appeared to be relieved, and sank back with a sigh upon the pillow. I stepped up to her with a few reassuring words, and she lay still while I took her pulse and temperature. Both were high, and yet my impression was that the condition was rather that of mental and nervous excitement than of any actual seizure. She lie like that one day, two day. I 'fraid she die, said the girl. The woman turned her flushed and handsome face towards me. Where is my husband? He is below, and would wish to see you. I will not see him. I will not see him. Then she seemed to wander off into delirium. A fiend! A fiend! Oh, what shall I do with this devil? Can I help you in any way? No. No one can help. It is finished. All is destroyed. Do what I will, all is destroyed. The woman must have some strange delusion. I could not see honest Bob Ferguson in the character of fiend or devil. Madame, I said, your husband loves you dearly. He is deeply grieved at this happening. Again she turned on me those glorious eyes. He loves me. Yes. But do I not love him? Do I not love him even to sacrifice myself rather than break his dear heart. That is how I love him. And yet he could think of me--he could speak of me so. He is full of grief, but he cannot understand. No, he cannot understand. But he should trust. Will you not see him? I suggested. No, no; I cannot forget those terrible words nor the look upon his face. I will not see him. Go now. You can do nothing for me. Tell him only one thing. I want my child. I have a right to my child. That is the only message I can send him. She turned her face to the wall and would say no more. I returned to the room downstairs, where Ferguson and Holmes still sat by the fire. Ferguson listened moodily to my account of the interview. How can I send her the child? he said. How do I know what strange impulse might come upon her? How can I ever forget how she rose from beside it with its blood upon her lips? He shuddered at the recollection. The child is safe with Mrs. Mason, and there he must remain. A smart maid, the only modern thing which we had seen in the house, had brought in some tea. As she was serving it the door opened and a youth entered the room. He was a remarkable lad, pale-faced and fair-haired, with excitable light blue eyes which blazed into a sudden flame of emotion and joy as they rested upon his father. He rushed forward and threw his arms round his neck with the abandon of a loving girl. Oh, daddy, he cried, I did not know that you were due yet. I should have been here to meet you. Oh, I am so glad to see you! Ferguson gently disengaged himself from the embrace with some little show of embarrassment. Dear old chap, said he, patting the flaxen head with a very tender hand. I came early because my friends, Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson, have been persuaded to come down and spend an evening with us. Is that Mr. Holmes, the detective? Yes. The youth looked at us with a very penetrating and, as it seemed to me, unfriendly gaze. What about your other child, Mr. Ferguson? asked Holmes. Might we make the acquaintance of the baby? Ask Mrs. Mason to bring baby down, said Ferguson. The boy went off with a curious, shambling gait which told my surgical eyes that he was suffering from a weak spine. Presently he returned, and behind him came a tall, gaunt woman bearing in her arms a very beautiful child, dark-eyed, golden-haired, a wonderful mixture of the Saxon and the Latin. Ferguson was evidently devoted to it, for he took it into his arms and fondled it most tenderly. Fancy anyone having the heart to hurt him, he muttered, as he glanced down at the small, angry red pucker upon the cherub throat. It was at this moment that I chanced to glance at Holmes, and saw a most singular intentness in his expression. His face was as set as if it had been carved out of old ivory, and his eyes, which had glanced for a moment at father and child, were now fixed with eager curiosity upon something at the other side of the room. Following his gaze I could only guess that he was looking out through the window at the melancholy, dripping garden. It is true that a shutter had half closed outside and obstructed the view, but none the less it was certainly at the window that Holmes was fixing his concentrated attention. Then he smiled, and his eyes came back to the baby. On its chubby neck there was this small puckered mark. Without speaking, Holmes examined it with care. Finally he shook one of the dimpled fists which waved in front of him. Good-bye, little man. You have made a strange start in life. Nurse, I should wish to have a word with you in private. He took her aside and spoke earnestly for a few minutes. I only heard the last words, which were: Your anxiety will soon, I hope, be set at rest. The woman, who seemed to be a sour, silent kind of creature, withdrew with the child. What is Mrs. Mason like? asked Holmes. Not very prepossessing externally, as you can see, but a heart of gold, and devoted to the child. Do you like her, Jack? Holmes turned suddenly upon the boy. His expressive mobile face shadowed over, and he shook his head. Jacky has very strong likes and dislikes, said Ferguson, putting his arm round the boy. Luckily I am one of his likes. The boy cooed and nestled his head upon his father's breast. Ferguson gently disengaged him. Run away, little Jacky, said he, and he watched his son with loving eyes until he disappeared. Now, Mr. Holmes, he continued, when the boy was gone, I really feel that I have brought you on a fool's errand, for what can you possibly do, save give me your sympathy? It must be an exceedingly delicate and complex affair from your point of view. It is certainly delicate, said my friend, with an amused smile, but I have not been struck up to now with its complexity. It has been a case for intellectual deduction, but when this original intellectual deduction is confirmed point by point by quite a number of independent incidents, then the subjective becomes objective and we can say confidently that we have reached our goal. I had, in fact, reached it before we left Baker Street, and the rest has merely been observation and confirmation. Ferguson put his big hand to his furrowed forehead. For Heaven's sake, Holmes, he said hoarsely, if you can see the truth in this matter, do not keep me in suspense. How do I stand? What shall I do? I care nothing as to how you have found your facts so long as you have really got them. Certainly I owe you an explanation, and you shall have it. But you will permit me to handle the matter in my own way? Is the lady capable of seeing us, Watson? She is ill, but she is quite rational. Very good. It is only in her presence that we can clear the matter up. Let us go up to her. She will not see me, cried Ferguson. Oh, yes, she will, said Holmes. He scribbled a few lines upon a sheet of paper. You at least have the _entrée_, Watson. Will you have the goodness to give the lady this note? I ascended again and handed the note to Dolores, who cautiously opened the door. A minute later I heard a cry from within, a cry in which joy and surprise seemed to be blended. Dolores looked out. She will see them. She will leesten, said she. At my summons Ferguson and Holmes came up. As we entered the room Ferguson took a step or two towards his wife, who had raised herself in the bed, but she held out her hand to repulse him. He sank into an arm-chair, while Holmes seated himself beside him, after bowing to the lady, who looked at him with wide-eyed amazement. I think we can dispense with Dolores, said Holmes. Oh, very well, madame, if you would rather she stayed I can see no objection. Now, Mr. Ferguson, I am a busy man with many calls, and my methods have to be short and direct. The swiftest surgery is the least painful. Let me first say what will ease your mind. Your wife is a very good, a very loving, and a very ill-used woman. Ferguson sat up with a cry of joy. Prove that, Mr. Holmes, and I am your debtor for ever. I will do so, but in doing so I must wound you deeply in another direction. I care nothing so long as you clear my wife. Everything on earth is insignificant compared to that. Let me tell you, then, the train of reasoning which passed through my mind in Baker Street. The idea of a vampire was to me absurd. Such things do not happen in criminal practice in England. And yet your observation was precise. You had seen the lady rise from beside the child's cot with the blood upon her lips. I did. Did it not occur to you that a bleeding wound may be sucked for some other purpose than to draw the blood from it? Was there not a Queen in English history who sucked such a wound to draw poison from it? Poison! A South American household. My instinct felt the presence of those weapons upon the wall before my eyes ever saw them. It might have been other poison, but that was what occurred to me. When I saw that little empty quiver beside the small bird-bow, it was just what I expected to see. If the child were pricked with one of those arrows dipped in curare or some other devilish drug, it would mean death if the venom were not sucked out. And the dog! If one were to use such a poison, would one not try it first in order to see that it had not lost its power? I did not foresee the dog, but at least I understood him and he fitted into my reconstruction. Now do you understand? Your wife feared such an attack. She saw it made and saved the child's life, and yet she shrank from telling you all the truth, for she knew how you loved the boy and feared lest it break your heart. Jacky! I watched him as you fondled the child just now. His face was clearly reflected in the glass of the window where the shutter formed a background. I saw such jealousy, such cruel hatred, as I have seldom seen in a human face. My Jacky! You have to face it, Mr. Ferguson. It is the more painful because it is a distorted love, a maniacal exaggerated love for you, and possibly for his dead mother, which has prompted his action. His very soul is consumed with hatred for this splendid child, whose health and beauty are a contrast to his own weakness. Good God! It is incredible! Have I spoken the truth, madame? The lady was sobbing, with her face buried in the pillows. Now she turned to her husband. How could I tell you, Bob? I felt the blow it would be to you. It was better that I should wait and that it should come from some other lips than mine. When this gentleman, who seems to have powers of magic, wrote that he knew all, I was glad. I think a year at sea would be my prescription for Master Jacky, said Holmes, rising from his chair. Only one thing is still clouded, madame. We can quite understand your attacks upon Master Jacky. There is a limit to a mother's patience. But how did you dare to leave the child these last two days? I had told Mrs. Mason. She knew. Exactly. So I imagined. Ferguson was standing by the bed, choking, his hands outstretched and quivering. This, I fancy, is the time for our exit, Watson, said Holmes in a whisper. If you will take one elbow of the too faithful Dolores, I will take the other. There, now, he added, as he closed the door behind him, I think we may leave them to settle the rest among themselves. I have only one further note of this case. It is the letter which Holmes wrote in final answer to that with which the narrative begins. It ran thus: BAKER STREET, _Nov._ 21st. _Re_ Vampires. SIR,-- Referring to your letter of the 19th, I beg to state that I have looked into the inquiry of your client, Mr. Robert Ferguson, of Ferguson and Muirhead, tea brokers, of Mincing Lane, and that the matter has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. With thanks for your recommendation, I am, Sir, Faithfully yours, SHERLOCK HOLMES. VI THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE GARRIDEBS It may have been a comedy, or it may have been a tragedy. It cost one man his reason, it cost me a blood-letting, and it cost yet another man the penalties of the law. Yet there was certainly an element of comedy. Well, you shall judge for yourselves. I remember the date very well, for it was in the same month that Holmes refused a knighthood for services which may perhaps some day be described. I only refer to the matter in passing, for in my position of partner and confidant I am obliged to be particularly careful to avoid any indiscretion. I repeat, however, that this enables me to fix the date, which was the latter end of June, 1902, shortly after the conclusion of the South African War. Holmes had spent several days in bed, as was his habit from time to time, but he emerged that morning with a long foolscap document in his hand and a twinkle of amusement in his austere grey eyes. There is a chance for you to make some money, friend Watson, said he. Have you ever heard the name of Garrideb? I admitted that I had not. Well, if you can lay your hand upon a Garrideb, there's money in it. Why? Ah, that's a long story--rather a whimsical one, too. I don't think in all our explorations of human complexities we have ever come upon anything more singular. The fellow will be here presently for cross-examination, so I won't open the matter up till he comes. But meanwhile, that's the name we want. The telephone directory lay on the table beside me, and I turned over the pages in a rather hopeless quest. But to my amazement there was this strange name in its due place. I gave a cry of triumph. Here you are, Holmes! Here it is! Holmes took the book from my hand. 'Garrideb, N.,' he read, '136 Little Ryder Street, W.' Sorry to disappoint you, my dear Watson, but this is the man himself. That is the address upon his letter. We want another to match him. Mrs. Hudson had come in with a card upon a tray. I took it up and glanced at it. Why, here it is! I cried in amazement. This is a different initial. John Garrideb, Counsellor at Law, Moorville, Kansas, U.S.A. Holmes smiled as he looked at the card. I am afraid you must make yet another effort, Watson, said he. This gentleman is also in the plot already, though I certainly did not expect to see him this morning. However, he is in a position to tell us a good deal which I want to know. A moment later he was in the room. Mr. John Garrideb, Counsellor at Law, was a short, powerful man with the round, fresh, clean-shaven face characteristic of so many American men of affairs. The general effect was chubby and rather childlike, so that one received the impression of quite a young man with a broad set smile upon his face. His eyes, however, were arresting. Seldom in any human head have I seen a pair which bespoke a more intense inward life, so bright were they, so alert, so responsive to every change of thought. His accent was American, but was not accompanied by any eccentricity of speech. Mr. Holmes? he asked, glancing from one to the other. Ah, yes! Your pictures are not unlike you, sir, if I may say so.

       "\"THE ADVENTURE OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS CLIENT It can't hurt now was Mr Sherlock Holmes's comment when for the tenth time in as many years I asked his leave to reveal the following narrative So it was that at last I obtained permission to put on record what was in some ways the supreme moment of my friend's career Both Holmes and I had a weakness for the Turkish Bath It was over a smoke in the pleasant lassitude of the drying-room that I have found him less reticent and more human than anywhere else On the upper floor of the Northumberland Avenue establishment there is an isolated corner where two couches lie side by side and it was on these that we lay upon September 3 1902 the day when my narrative begins I had asked him whether anything was stirring and for answer he had shot his long thin nervous arm out of the sheets which enveloped him and had drawn an envelope from the inside pocket of the coat which hung beside him It may be some fussy self-important fool it may be a matter of life or death said he as he handed me the note I know no more than this message tells me It was from the Carlton Club and dated the evening before This is what I read Sir James Damery presents his compliments to Mr Sherlock Holmes and will call upon him at 430 to-morrow Sir James begs to say that the matter upon which he desires to consult Mr Holmes is very delicate and also very important He trusts therefore that Mr Holmes will make every effort to grant this interview and that he will confirm it over the telephone to the Carlton Club I need not say that I have confirmed it Watson said Holmes as I returned the paper Do you know anything of this man Damery Only that his name is a household word in Society Well I can tell you a little more than that He has rather a reputation for arranging delicate matters which are to be kept out of the papers You may remember his negotiations with Sir George Lewis over the Hammerford Will case He is a man of the world with a natural turn for diplomacy I am bound therefore to hope that it is not a false scent and that he has some real need for our assistance Our Well if you will be so good Watson I shall be honoured Then you have the hour--four-thirty Until then we can put the matter out of our heads I was living in my own rooms in Queen Anne Street at the time but I was round at Baker Street before the time named Sharp to the half-hour Colonel Sir James Damery was announced It is hardly necessary to describe him for many will remember that large bluff honest personality that broad clean-shaven face above all that pleasant mellow voice Frankness shone from his grey Irish eyes and good humour played round his mobile smiling lips His lucent top-hat his dark frock-coat indeed every detail from the pearl pin in the black satin cravat to the lavender spats over the varnished shoes spoke of the meticulous care in dress for which he was famous The big masterful aristocrat dominated the little room Of course I was prepared to find Dr Watson he remarked with a courteous bow His collaboration may be very necessary for we are dealing on this occasion Mr Holmes with a man to whom violence is familiar and who will literally stick at nothing I should say that there is no more dangerous man in Europe I have had several opponents to whom that flattering term has been applied said Holmes with a smile Don't you smoke Then you will excuse me if I light my pipe If your man is more dangerous than the late Professor Moriarty or than the living Colonel Sebastian Moran then he is indeed worth meeting May I ask his name Have you ever heard of Baron Gruner You mean the Austrian murderer Colonel Damery threw up his kid-gloved hands with a laugh There is no getting past you Mr Holmes Wonderful So you have already sized him up as a murderer It is my business to follow the details of Continental crime Who could possibly have read what happened at Prague and have any doubts as to the man's guilt It was a purely technical legal point and the suspicious death of a witness that saved him I am as sure that he killed his wife when the so-called 'accident' happened in the Splügen Pass as if I had seen him do it I knew also that he had come to England and had a presentiment that sooner or later he would find me some work to do Well what has Baron Gruner been up to I presume it is not this old tragedy which has come up again No it is more serious than that To revenge crime is important but to prevent it is more so It is a terrible thing Mr Holmes to see a dreadful event an atrocious situation preparing itself before your eyes to clearly understand whither it will lead and yet to be utterly unable to avert it Can a human being be placed in a more trying position Perhaps not Then you will sympathize with the client in whose interests I am acting I did not understand that you were merely an intermediary Who is the principal Mr Holmes I must beg you not to press that question It is important that I should be able to assure him that his honoured name has been in no way dragged into the matter His motives are to the last degree honourable and chivalrous but he prefers to remain unknown I need not say that your fees will be assured and that you will be given a perfectly free hand Surely the actual name of your client is immaterial I am sorry said Holmes I am accustomed to have mystery at one end of my cases but to have it at both ends is too confusing I fear Sir James that I must decline to act Our visitor was greatly disturbed His large sensitive face was darkened with emotion and disappointment You hardly realize the effect of your own action Mr Holmes said he You place me in a most serious dilemma for I am perfectly certain that you would be proud to take over the case if I could give you the facts and yet a promise forbids me from revealing them all May I at least lay all that I can before you By all means so long as it is understood that I commit myself to nothing That is understood In the first place you have no doubt heard of General de Merville De Merville of Khyber fame Yes I have heard of him He has a daughter Violet de Merville young rich beautiful accomplished a wonder-woman in every way It is this daughter this lovely innocent girl whom we are endeavouring to save from the clutches of a fiend Baron Gruner has some hold over her then The strongest of all holds where a woman is concerned--the hold of love The fellow is as you may have heard extraordinarily handsome with a most fascinating manner a gentle voice and that air of romance and mystery which means so much to a woman He is said to have the whole sex at his mercy and to have made ample use of the fact But how came such a man to meet a lady of the standing of Miss Violet de Merville It was on a Mediterranean yachting voyage The company though select paid their own passages No doubt the promoters hardly realized the Baron's true character until it was too late The villain attached himself to the lady and with such effect that he has completely and absolutely won her heart To say that she loves him hardly expresses it She dotes upon him she is obsessed by him Outside of him there is nothing on earth She will not hear one word against him Everything has been done to cure her of her madness but in vain To sum up she proposes to marry him next month As she is of age and has a will of iron it is hard to know how to prevent her Does she know about the Austrian episode The cunning devil has told her every unsavoury public scandal of his past life but always in such a way as to make himself out to be an innocent martyr She absolutely accepts his version and will listen to no other Dear me But surely you have inadvertently let out the name of your client It is no doubt General de Merville Our visitor fidgeted in his chair I could deceive you by saying so Mr Holmes but it would not be true De Merville is a broken man The strong soldier has been utterly demoralized by this incident He has lost the nerve which never failed him on the battlefield and has become a weak doddering old man utterly incapable of contending with a brilliant forceful rascal like this Austrian My client however is an old friend one who has known the General intimately for many years and taken a paternal interest in this young girl since she wore short frocks He cannot see this tragedy consummated without some attempt to stop it There is nothing in which Scotland Yard can act It was his own suggestion that you should be called in but it was as I have said on the express stipulation that he should not be personally involved in the matter I have no doubt Mr Holmes with your great powers you could easily trace my client back through me but I must ask you as a point of honour to refrain from doing so and not to break in upon his incognito Holmes gave a whimsical smile I think I may safely promise that said he I may add that your problem interests me and that I shall be prepared to look into it How shall I keep in touch with you The Carlton Club will find me But in case of emergency there is a private telephone call 'XX31' Holmes noted it down and sat still smiling with the open memorandum-book upon his knee The Baron's present address please Vernon Lodge near Kingston It is a large house He has been fortunate in some rather shady speculations and is a rich man which naturally makes him a more dangerous antagonist Is he at home at present Yes Apart from what you have told me can you give me any further information about the man He has expensive tastes He is a horse fancier For a short time he played polo at Hurlingham but then this Prague affair got noised about and he had to leave He collects books and pictures He is a man with a considerable artistic side to his nature He is I believe a recognized authority upon Chinese pottery and has written a book upon the subject A complex mind said Holmes All great criminals have that My old friend Charlie Peace was a violin virtuoso Wainwright was no mean artist I could quote many more Well Sir James you will inform your client that I am turning my mind upon Baron Gruner I can say no more I have some sources of information of my own and dare say we may find some means of opening matter up When our visitor had left us Holmes sat so long in deep thought that it seemed to me that he had forgotten my presence At last however he came briskly back to earth Well Watson any views he asked I should think you had better see the young lady herself My dear Watson if her poor old broken father cannot move her how shall I a stranger prevail And yet there is something in the suggestion if all else fails But I think we must begin from a different angle I rather fancy that Shinwell Johnson might be a help I have not had occasion to mention Shinwell Johnson in these memoirs because I have seldom drawn my cases from the latter phases of my friend's career During the first years of the century he became a valuable assistant Johnson I grieve to say made his name first as a very dangerous villain and served two terms at Parkhurst Finally he repented and allied himself to Holmes acting as his agent in the huge criminal underworld of London and obtaining information which often proved to be of vital importance Had Johnson been a nark of the police he would soon have been exposed but as he dealt with cases which never came directly into the courts his activities were never realized by his companions With the glamour of his two convictions upon him he had the _entrée_ of every night-club doss-house and gambling-den in the town and his quick observation and active brain made him an ideal agent for gaining information It was to him that Sherlock Holmes now proposed to turn It was not possible for me to follow the immediate steps taken by my friend for I had some pressing professional business of my own but I met him by appointment that evening at Simpson's where sitting at a small table in the front window and looking down at the rushing stream of life in the Strand he told me something of what had passed Johnson is on the prowl said he He may pick up some garbage in the darker recesses of the underworld for it is down there amid the black roots of crime that we must hunt for this man's secrets But if the lady will not accept what is already known why should any fresh discovery of yours turn her from her purpose Who knows Watson Woman's heart and mind are insoluble puzzles to the male Murder might be condoned or explained and yet some smaller offence might rankle Baron Gruner remarked to me---- He remarked to you Oh to be sure I had not told you of my plans Well Watson I love to come to close grips with my man I like to meet him eye to eye and read for myself the stuff that he is made of When I had given Johnson his instructions I took a cab out to Kingston and found the Baron in a most affable mood Did he recognize you There was no difficulty about that for I simply sent in my card He is an excellent antagonist cool as ice silky voiced and soothing as one of your fashionable consultants and poisonous as a cobra He has breed in him a real aristocrat of crime with a superficial suggestion of afternoon tea and all the cruelty of the grave behind it Yes I am glad to have had my attention called to Baron Adelbert Gruner You say he was affable A purring cat who thinks he sees prospective mice Some people's affability is more deadly than the violence of coarser souls His greeting was characteristic 'I rather thought I should see you sooner or later Mr Holmes' said he 'You have been engaged no doubt by General de Merville to endeavour to stop my marriage with his daughter Violet That is so is it not' I acquiesced 'My dear man' said he 'you will only ruin your own well-deserved reputation It is not a case in which you can possibly succeed You will have barren work to say nothing of incurring some danger Let me very strongly advise you to draw off at once' 'It is curious' I answered 'but that was the very advice which I had intended to give you I have a respect for your brains Baron and the little which I have seen of your personality has not lessened it Let me put it to you as man to man No one wants to rake up your past and make you unduly uncomfortable It is over and you are now in smooth waters but if you persist in this marriage you will raise up a swarm of powerful enemies who will never leave you alone until they have made England too hot to hold you Is the game worth it Surely you would be wiser if you left the lady alone It would not be pleasant for you if these facts of your past were brought to her notice' The Baron has little waxed tips of hair under his nose like the short antennae of an insect These quivered with amusement as he listened and he finally broke into a gentle chuckle 'Excuse my amusement Mr Holmes' said he 'but it is really funny to see you trying to play a hand with no cards in it I don't think anyone could do it better but it is rather pathetic all the same Not a colour card there Mr Holmes nothing but the smallest of the small' 'So you think' 'So I know Let me make the thing clear to you for my own hand is so strong that I can afford to show it I have been fortunate enough to win the entire affection of this lady This was given to me in spite of the fact that I told her very clearly of all the unhappy incidents in my past life I also told her that certain wicked and designing persons--I hope you recognize yourself--would come to her and tell her these things and I warned her how to treat them You have heard of post-hypnotic suggestion Mr Holmes Well you will see how it works for a man of personality can use hypnotism without any vulgar passes or tomfoolery So she is ready for you and I have no doubt would give you an appointment for she is quite amenable to her father's will--save only in the one little matter' Well Watson there seemed to be no more to say so I took my leave with as much cold dignity as I could summon but as I had my hand on the door-handle he stopped me 'By the way Mr Holmes' said he 'did you know Le Brun the French agent' 'Yes' said I 'Do you know what befell him' 'I heard that he was beaten by some Apaches in the Montmartre district and crippled for life' 'Quite true Mr Holmes By a curious coincidence he had been inquiring into my affairs only a week before Don't do it Mr Holmes it's not a lucky thing to do Several have found that out My last word to you is go your own way and let me go mine Good-bye' So there you are Watson You are up to date now The fellow seems dangerous Mighty dangerous I disregard the blusterer but this is the sort of man who says rather less than he means Must you interfere Does it really matter if he marries the girl Considering that he undoubtedly murdered his last wife I should say it mattered very much Besides the client Well well we need not discuss that When you have finished your coffee you had best come home with me for the blithe Shinwell will be there with his report We found him sure enough a huge coarse red-faced scorbutic man with a pair of vivid black eyes which were the only external sign of the very cunning mind within It seems that he had dived down into what was peculiarly his kingdom and beside him on the settee was a brand which he had brought up in the shape of a slim flame-like young woman with a pale intense face youthful and yet so worn with sin and sorrow that one read the terrible years which had left their leprous mark upon her This is Miss Kitty Winter said Shinwell Johnson waving his fat hand as an introduction What she don't know--well there she'll speak for herself Put my hand right on her Mr Holmes within an hour of your message I'm easy to find said the young woman Hell London gets me every time Same address for Porky Shinwell We're old mates Porky you and I But by Gripes there is another who ought to be down in a lower hell than we if there was any justice in the world That is the man you are after Mr Holmes Holmes smiled I gather we have your good wishes Miss Winter If I can help to put him where he belongs I'm yours to the rattle said our visitor with fierce energy There was an intensity of hatred in her white set face and her blazing eyes such as woman seldom and man never can attain You needn't go into my past Mr Holmes That's neither here nor there But what I am Adelbert Gruner made me If I could pull him down She clutched frantically with her hands into the air Oh if I could only pull him into the pit where he has pushed so many You know how the matter stands Porky Shinwell has been telling me He's after some other poor fool and wants to marry her this time You want to stop it Well you surely know enough about this devil to prevent any decent girl in her senses wanting to be in the same parish with him She is not in her senses She is madly in love She has been told all about him She cares nothing Told about the murder Yes My Lord she must have a nerve She puts them all down as slanders Couldn't you lay proofs before her silly eyes Well can you help us do so Ain't I a proof myself If I stood before her and told her how he used me---- Would you do this Would I Would I not Well it might be worth trying But he has told her most of his sins and had pardon from her and I understand she will not reopen the question I'll lay he didn't tell her all said Miss Winter I caught a glimpse of one or two murders besides the one that made such a fuss He would speak of someone in his velvet way and then look at me with a steady eye and say 'He died within a month' It wasn't hot air either But I took little notice--you see I loved him myself at that time Whatever he did went with me same as with this poor fool There was just one thing that shook me Yes by Gripes if it had not been for his poisonous lying tongue that explains and soothes I'd have left him that very night It's a book he has--a brown leather book with a lock and his arms in gold on the outside I think he was a bit drunk that night or he would not have shown it to me What was it then I tell you Mr Holmes this man collects women and takes a pride in his collection as some men collect moths or butterflies He had it all in that book Snapshot photographs names details everything about them It was a beastly book--a book no man even if he had come from the gutter could have put together But it was Adelbert Gruner's book all the same 'Souls I have ruined' He could have put that on the outside if he had been so minded However that's neither here nor there for the book would not serve you and if it would you can't get it Where is it How can I tell you where it is now It's more than a year since I left him I know where he kept it then He's a precise tidy cat of a man in many of his ways so maybe it is still in the pigeon-hole of the old bureau in the inner study Do you know his house I've been in the study said Holmes Have you though You haven't been slow on the job if you only started this morning Maybe dear Adelbert has met his match this time The outer study is the one with the Chinese crockery in it--big glass cupboard between the windows Then behind his desk is the door that leads to the inner study--a small room where he keeps papers and things Is he not afraid of burglars Adelbert is no coward His worst enemy couldn't say that of him He can look after himself There's a burglar alarm at night Besides what is there for a burglar--unless they got away with all this fancy crockery No good said Shinwell Johnson with the decided voice of the expert No fence wants stuff of that sort that you can neither melt nor sell Quite so said Holmes Well now Miss Winter if you would call here to-morrow evening at five I would consider in the meanwhile whether your suggestion of seeing this lady personally may not be arranged I am exceedingly obliged to you for your co-operation I need not say that my clients will consider liberally---- None of that Mr Holmes cried the young woman I am not out for money Let me see this man in the mud and I've got all I worked for--in the mud with my foot on his cursed face That's my price I'm with you to-morrow or any other day so long as you are on his track Porky here can tell you always where to find me I did not see Holmes again until the following evening when we dined once more at our Strand restaurant He shrugged his shoulders when I asked him what luck he had had in his interview Then he told the story which I would repeat in this way His hard dry statement needs some little editing to soften it into the terms of real life There was no difficulty at all about the appointment said Holmes for the girl glories in showing abject filial obedience in all secondary things in an attempt to atone for her flagrant breach of it in her engagement The General 'phoned that all was ready and the fiery Miss W turned up according to schedule so that at half-past five a cab deposited us outside 104 Berkeley Square where the old soldier resides--one of those awful grey London castles which would make a church seem frivolous A footman showed us into a great yellow-curtained drawing-room and there was the lady awaiting us demure pale self-contained as inflexible and remote as a snow image on a mountain I don't quite know how to make her clear to you Watson Perhaps you may meet her before we are through and you can use your own gift of words She is beautiful but with the ethereal other-world beauty of some fanatic whose thoughts are set on high I have seen such faces in the pictures of the old masters of the Middle Ages How a beast-man could have laid his vile paws upon such a being of the beyond I cannot imagine You may have noticed how extremes call to each other the spiritual to the animal the cave-man to the angel You never saw a worse case than this She knew what we had come for of course--that villain had lost no time in poisoning her mind against us Miss Winter's advent rather amazed her I think but she waved us into our respective chairs like a Reverend Abbess receiving two rather leprous mendicants If your head is inclined to swell my dear Watson take a course of Miss Violet de Merville 'Well sir' said she in a voice like the wind from an iceberg 'your name is familiar to me You have called as I understand to malign my fiancé Baron Gruner It is only by my father's request that I see you at all and I warn you in advance that anything you can say could not possibly have the slightest effect upon my mind' I was sorry for her Watson I thought of her for the moment as I would have thought of a daughter of my own I am not often eloquent I use my head not my heart But I really did plead with her with all the warmth of words that I could find in my nature I pictured to her the awful position of the woman who only wakes to a man's character after she is his wife--a woman who has to submit to be caressed by bloody hands and lecherous lips I spared her nothing--the shame the fear the agony the hopelessness of it all All my hot words could not bring one tinge of colour to those ivory cheeks or one gleam of emotion to those abstracted eyes I thought of what the rascal had said about a post-hypnotic influence One could really believe that she was living above the earth in some ecstatic dream Yet there was nothing indefinite in her replies 'I have listened to you with patience Mr Holmes' said she 'The effect upon my mind is exactly as predicted I am aware that Adelbert that my fiancé has had a stormy life in which he has incurred bitter hatreds and most unjust aspersions You are only the last of a series who have brought their slanders before me Possibly you mean well though I learn that you are a paid agent who would have been equally willing to act for the Baron as against him But in any case I wish you to understand once for all that I love him and that he loves me and that the opinion of all the world is no more to me than the twitter of those birds outside the window If his noble nature has ever for an instant fallen it may be that I have been specially sent to raise it to its true and lofty level I am not clear' here she turned her eyes upon my companion 'who this young lady may be' I was about to answer when the girl broke in like a whirlwind If ever you saw flame and ice face to face it was those two women 'I'll tell you who I am' she cried springing out of her chair her mouth all twisted with passion--'I am his last mistress I am one of a hundred that he has tempted and used and ruined and thrown into the refuse heap as he will you also _Your_ refuse heap is more likely to be a grave and maybe that's the best I tell you you foolish woman if you marry this man he'll be the death of you It may be a broken heart or it may be a broken neck but he'll have you one way or the other It's not out of love for you I'm speaking I don't care a tinker's curse whether you live or die It's out of hate for him and to spite him and to get back on him for what he did to me But it's all the same and you needn't look at me like that my fine lady for you may be lower than I am before you are through with it' 'I should prefer not to discuss such matters' said Miss de Merville coldly 'Let me say once for all that I am aware of three passages in my fiancé's life in which he became entangled with designing women and that I am assured of his hearty repentance for any evil that he may have done' 'Three passages' screamed my companion 'You fool You unutterable fool' 'Mr Holmes I beg that you will bring this interview to an end' said the icy voice 'I have obeyed my father's wish in seeing you but I am not compelled to listen to the ravings of this person' With an oath Miss Winter darted forward and if I had not caught her wrist she would have clutched this maddening woman by the hair I dragged her towards the door and was lucky to get her back into the cab without a public scene for she was beside herself with rage In a cold way I felt pretty furious myself Watson for there was something indescribably annoying in the calm aloofness and supreme self-complaisance of the woman whom we were trying to save So now once again you know exactly how we stand and it is clear that I must plan some fresh opening move for this gambit won't work I'll keep in touch with you Watson for it is more than likely that you will have your part to play though it is just possible that the next move may lie with them rather than with us And it did Their blow fell--or his blow rather for never could I believe that the lady was privy to it I think I could show you the very paving-stone upon which I stood when my eyes fell upon the placard and a pang of horror passed through my very soul It was between the Grand Hotel and Charing Cross Station where a one-legged news-vendor displayed his evening papers The date was just two days after the last conversation There black upon yellow was the terrible news-sheet +-------------+ | MURDEROUS | | ATTACK | | UPON | | SHERLOCK | | HOLMES | +-------------+ I think I stood stunned for some moments Then I have a confused recollection of snatching at a paper of the remonstrance of the man whom I had not paid and finally of standing in the doorway of a chemist's shop while I turned up the fateful paragraph This was how it ran We learn with regret that Mr Sherlock Holmes the well-known private detective was the victim this morning of a murderous assault which has left him in a precarious position There are no exact details to hand but the event seems to have occurred about twelve o'clock in Regent Street outside the Café Royal The attack was made by two men armed with sticks and Mr Holmes was beaten about the head and body receiving injuries which the doctors describe as most serious He was carried to Charing Cross Hospital and afterwards insisted upon being taken to his rooms in Baker Street The miscreants who attacked him appear to have been respectably dressed men who escaped from the bystanders by passing through the Café Royal and out into Glasshouse Street behind it No doubt they belonged to that criminal fraternity which has so often had occasion to bewail the activity and ingenuity of the injured man I need not say that my eyes had hardly glanced over the paragraph before I had sprung into a hansom and was on my way to Baker Street I found Sir Leslie Oakshott the famous surgeon in the hall and his brougham waiting at the kerb No immediate danger was his report Two lacerated scalp wounds and some considerable bruises Several stitches have been necessary Morphine has been injected and quiet is essential but an interview of a few minutes would not be absolutely forbidden With this permission I stole into the darkened room The sufferer was wide awake and I heard my name in a hoarse whisper The blind was three-quarters down but one ray of sunlight slanted through and struck the bandaged head of the injured man A crimson patch had soaked through the white linen compress I sat beside him and bent my head All right Watson Don't look so scared he muttered in a very weak voice It's not as bad as it seems Thank God for that I'm a bit of a single-stick expert as you know I took most of them on my guard It was the second man that was too much for me What can I do Holmes Of course it was that damned fellow who set them on I'll go and thrash the hide off him if you give the word Good old Watson No we can do nothing there unless the police lay their hands on the men But their get-away had been well prepared We may be sure of that Wait a little I have my plans The first thing is to exaggerate my injuries They'll come to you for news Put it on thick Watson Lucky if I live the week out--concussion--delirium--what you like You can't overdo it But Sir Leslie Oakshott Oh he's all right He shall see the worst side of me I'll look after that Anything else Yes Tell Shinwell Johnson to get that girl out of the way Those beauties will be after her now They know of course that she was with me in the case If they dared to do me in it is not likely they will neglect her That is urgent Do it to-night I'll go now Anything more Put my pipe on the table--and the tobacco-slipper Right Come in each morning and we will plan our campaign I arranged with Johnson that evening to take Miss Winter to a quiet suburb and see that she lay low until the danger was past For six days the public were under the impression that Holmes was at the door of death The bulletins were very grave and there were sinister paragraphs in the papers My continual visits assured me that it was not so bad as that His wiry constitution and his determined will were working wonders He was recovering fast and I had suspicions at times that he was really finding himself faster than he pretended even to me There was a curious secretive streak in the man which led to many dramatic effects but left even his closest friend guessing as to what his exact plans might be He pushed to an extreme the axiom that the only safe plotter was he who plotted alone I was nearer him than anyone else and yet I was always conscious of the gap between On the seventh day the stitches were taken out in spite of which there was a report of erysipelas in the evening papers The same evening papers had an announcement which I was bound sick or well to carry to my friend It was simply that among the passengers on the Cunard boat _Ruritania_ starting from Liverpool on Friday was the Baron Adelbert Gruner who had some important financial business to settle in the States before his impending wedding to Miss Violet de Merville only daughter of etc etc Holmes listened to the news with a cold concentrated look upon his pale face which told me that it hit him hard Friday he cried Only three clear days I believe the rascal wants to put himself out of danger's way But he won't Watson By the Lord Harry he won't Now Watson I want you to do something for me I am here to be used Holmes Well then spend the next twenty-four hours in an intensive study of Chinese pottery He gave no explanations and I asked for none By long experience I had learned the wisdom of obedience But when I had left his room I walked down Baker Street revolving in my head how on earth I was to carry out so strange an order Finally I drove to the London Library in St James's Square put the matter to my friend Lomax the sub-librarian and departed to my rooms with a goodly volume under my arm It is said that the barrister who crams up a case with such care that he can examine an expert witness upon the Monday has forgotten all his forced knowledge before the Saturday Certainly I should not like now to pose as an authority upon ceramics And yet all that evening and all that night with a short interval for rest and all next morning I was sucking in knowledge and committing names to memory There I learned of the hall-marks of the great artist-decorators of the mystery of cyclical dates the marks of the Hung-wu and the beauties of the Yung-lo the writings of Tang-ying and the glories of the primitive period of the Sung and the Yuan I was charged with all this information when I called upon Holmes next evening He was out of bed now though you would not have guessed it from the published reports and he sat with his much-bandaged head resting upon his hand in the depth of his favourite arm-chair Why Holmes I said if one believed the papers you are dying That said he is the very impression which I intended to convey And now Watson have you learned your lessons At least I have tried to Good You could keep up an intelligent conversation on the subject I believe I could Then hand me that little box from the mantel-piece He opened the lid and took out a small object most carefully wrapped in some fine Eastern silk This he unfolded and disclosed a delicate little saucer of the most beautiful deep-blue colour It needs careful handling Watson This is the real egg-shell pottery of the Ming dynasty No finer piece ever passed through Christie's A complete set of this would be worth a king's ransom--in fact it is doubtful if there is a complete set outside the Imperial palace of Peking The sight of this would drive a real connoisseur wild What am I to do with it Holmes handed me a card upon which was printed Dr Hill Barton 369 Half Moon Street That is your name for the evening Watson You will call upon Baron Gruner I know something of his habits and at half-past eight he would probably be disengaged A note will tell him in advance that you are about to call and you will say that you are bringing him a specimen of an absolutely unique set of Ming china You may as well be a medical man since that is a part which you can play without duplicity You are a collector this set has come your way you have heard of the Baron's interest in the subject and you are not averse to selling at a price What price Well asked Watson You would certainly fall down badly if you did not know the value of your own wares This saucer was got for me by Sir James and comes I understand from the collection of his client You will not exaggerate if you say that it could hardly be matched in the world I could perhaps suggest that the set should be valued by an expert Excellent Watson You scintillate to-day Suggest Christie or Sotheby Your delicacy prevents your putting a price for yourself But if he won't see me Oh yes he will see you He has the collection mania in its most acute form--and especially on this subject on which he is an acknowledged authority Sit down Watson and I will dictate the letter No answer needed You will merely say that you are coming and why It was an admirable document short courteous and stimulating to the curiosity of the connoisseur A district messenger was duly dispatched with it On the same evening with the precious saucer in my hand and the card of Dr Hill Barton in my pocket I set off on my own adventure The beautiful house and grounds indicated that Baron Gruner was as Sir James had said a man of considerable wealth A long winding drive with banks of rare shrubs on either side opened out into a great gravelled square adorned with statues The place had been built by a South African gold king in the days of the great boom and the long low house with the turrets at the corners though an architectural nightmare was imposing in its size and solidity A butler who would have adorned a bench of bishops showed me in and handed me over to a plush-clad footman who ushered me into the Baron's presence He was standing at the open front of a great case which stood between the windows and which contained part of his Chinese collection He turned as I entered with a small brown vase in his hand Pray sit down doctor said he I was looking over my own treasures and wondering whether I could really afford to add to them This little Tang specimen which dates from the seventh century would probably interest you I am sure you never saw finer workmanship or a richer glaze Have you the Ming saucer with you of which you spoke I carefully unpacked it and handed it to him He seated himself at his desk pulled over the lamp for it was growing dark and set himself to examine it As he did so the yellow light beat upon his own features and I was able to study them at my ease He was certainly a remarkably handsome man His European reputation for beauty was fully deserved In figure he was not more than of middle size but was built upon graceful and active lines His face was swarthy almost Oriental with large dark languorous eyes which might easily hold an irresistible fascination for women His hair and moustache were raven black the latter short pointed and carefully waxed His features were regular and pleasing save only his straight thin-lipped mouth If ever I saw a murderer's mouth it was there--a cruel hard gash in the face compressed inexorable and terrible He was ill-advised to train his moustache away from it for it was Nature's danger-signal set as a warning to his victims His voice was engaging and his manners perfect In age I should have put him at little over thirty though his record afterwards showed that he was forty-two Very fine--very fine indeed he said at last And you say you have a set of six to correspond What puzzles me is that I should not have heard of such magnificent specimens I only know of one in England to match this and it is certainly not likely to be in the market Would it be indiscreet if I were to ask you Dr Hill Barton how you obtained this Does it really matter I asked with as careless an air as I could muster You can see that the piece is genuine and as to the value I am content to take an expert's valuation Very mysterious said he with a quick suspicious flash of his dark eyes In dealing with objects of such value one naturally wishes to know all about the transaction That the piece is genuine is certain I have no doubts at all about that But suppose--I am bound to take every possibility into account--that it should prove afterwards that you had no right to sell I would guarantee you against any claim of the sort That of course would open up the question as to what your guarantee was worth My bankers would answer that Quite so And yet the whole transaction strikes me as rather unusual You can do business or not said I with indifference I have given you the first offer as I understood that you were a connoisseur but I shall have no difficulty in other quarters Who told you I was a connoisseur I was aware that you had written a book upon the subject Have you read the book No Dear me this becomes more and more difficult for me to understand You are a connoisseur and collector with a very valuable piece in your collection and yet you have never troubled to consult the one book which would have told you of the real meaning and value of what you held How do you explain that I am a very busy man I am a doctor in practice That is no answer If a man has a hobby he follows it up whatever his other pursuits may be You said in your note that you were a connoisseur So I am Might I ask you a few questions to test you I am obliged to tell you doctor--if you are indeed a doctor--that the incident becomes more and more suspicious I would ask you what do you know of the Emperor Shomu and how do you associate him with the Shoso-in near Nara Dear me does that puzzle you Tell me a little about the Northern Wei dynasty and its place in the history of ceramics I sprang from my chair in simulated anger This is intolerable sir said I I came here to do you a favour and not to be examined as if I were a schoolboy My knowledge on these subjects may be second only to your own but I certainly shall not answer questions which have been put in so offensive a way He looked at me steadily The languor had gone from his eyes They suddenly glared There was a gleam of teeth from between those cruel lips What is the game You are here as a spy You are an emissary of Holmes This is a trick that you are playing upon me The fellow is dying I hear so he sends his tools to keep watch upon me You've made your way in here without leave and by God you may find it harder to get out than to get in He had sprung to his feet and I stepped back bracing myself for an attack for the man was beside himself with rage He may have suspected me from the first certainly this cross-examination had shown him the truth but it was clear that I could not hope to deceive him He dived his hand into a side-drawer and rummaged furiously Then something struck upon his ear for he stood listening intently Ah he cried Ah and dashed into the room behind him Two steps took me to the open door and my mind will ever carry a clear picture of the scene within The window leading out to the garden was wide open Beside it looking like some terrible ghost his head girt with bloody bandages his face drawn and white stood Sherlock Holmes The next instant he was through the gap and I heard the crash of his body among the laurel bushes outside With a howl of rage the master of the house rushed after him to the open window And then It was done in an instant and yet I clearly saw it An arm--a woman's arm--shot out from among the leaves At the same instant the Baron uttered a horrible cry--a yell which will always ring in my memory He clapped his two hands to his face and rushed round the room beating his head horribly against the walls Then he fell upon the carpet rolling and writhing while scream after scream resounded through the house Water For God's sake water was his cry I seized a carafe from a side-table and rushed to his aid At the same moment the butler and several footmen ran in from the hall I remember that one of them fainted as I knelt by the injured man and turned that awful face to the light of the lamp The vitriol was eating into it everywhere and dripping from the ears and the chin One eye was already white and glazed The other was red and inflamed The features which I had admired a few minutes before were now like some beautiful painting over which the artist has passed a wet and foul sponge They were blurred discoloured inhuman terrible In a few words I explained exactly what had occurred so far as the vitriol attack was concerned Some had climbed through the window and others had rushed out on to the lawn but it was dark and it had begun to rain Between his screams the victim raged and raved against the avenger It was that hell-cat Kitty Winter he cried Oh the she-devil She shall pay for it She shall pay Oh God in heaven this pain is more than I can bear I bathed his face in oil put cotton wadding on the raw surfaces and administered a hypodermic of morphia All suspicion of me had passed from his mind in the presence of this shock and he clung to my hands as if I might have the power even yet to clear those dead-fish eyes which gazed up at me I could have wept over the ruin had I not remembered very clearly the vile life which had led up to so hideous a change It was loathsome to feel the pawing of his burning hands and I was relieved when his family surgeon closely followed by a specialist came to relieve me of my charge An inspector of police had also arrived and to him I handed my real card It would have been useless as well as foolish to do otherwise for I was nearly as well known by sight at the Yard as Holmes himself Then I left that house of gloom and terror Within an hour I was at Baker Street Holmes was seated in his familiar chair looking very pale and exhausted Apart from his injuries even his iron nerves had been shocked by the events of the evening and he listened with horror to my account of the Baron's transformation The wages of sin Watson--the wages of sin said he Sooner or later it will always come God knows there was sin enough he added taking up a brown volume from the table Here is the book the woman talked of If this will not break off the marriage nothing ever could But it will Watson It must No self-respecting woman could stand it It is his love diary Or his lust diary Call it what you will The moment the woman told us of it I realized what a tremendous weapon was there if we could but lay our hands on it I said nothing at the time to indicate my thoughts for this woman might have given it away But I brooded over it Then this assault upon me gave me the chance of letting the Baron think that no precautions need be taken against me That was all to the good I would have waited a little longer but his visit to America forced my hand He would never have left so compromising a document behind him Therefore we had to act at once Burglary at night is impossible He takes precautions But there was a chance in the evening if I could only be sure that his attention was engaged That was where you and your blue saucer came in But I had to be sure of the position of the book and I knew I had only a few minutes in which to act for my time was limited by your knowledge of Chinese pottery Therefore I gathered the girl up at the last moment How could I guess what the little packet was that she carried so carefully under her cloak I thought she had come altogether on my business but it seems she had some of her own He guessed I came from you I feared he would But you held him in play just long enough for me to get the book though not long enough for an unobserved escape Ah Sir James I am very glad you have come Our courtly friend had appeared in answer to a previous summons He listened with the deepest attention to Holmes's account of what had occurred You have done wonders--wonders he cried when he had heard the narrative But if these injuries are as terrible as Dr Watson describes then surely our purpose of thwarting the marriage is sufficiently gained without the use of this horrible book Holmes shook his head Women of the de Merville type do not act like that She would love him the more as a disfigured martyr No no It is his moral side not his physical which we have to destroy That book will bring her back to earth--and I know nothing else that could It is in his own writing She cannot get past it Sir James carried away both it and the precious saucer As I was myself overdue I went down with him into the street A brougham was waiting for him He sprang in gave a hurried order to the cockaded coachman and drove swiftly away He flung his overcoat half out of the window to cover the armorial bearings upon the panel but I had seen them in the glare of our fanlight none the less I gasped with surprise Then I turned back and ascended the stair to Holmes's room I have found out who our client is I cried bursting with my great news Why Holmes it is---- It is a loyal friend and a chivalrous gentleman said Holmes holding up a restraining hand Let that now and for ever be enough for us I do not know how the incriminating book was used Sir James may have managed it Or it is more probable that so delicate a task was entrusted to the young lady's father The effect at any rate was all that could be desired Three days later appeared a paragraph in _The Morning Post_ to say that the marriage between Baron Adelbert Gruner and Miss Violet de Merville would not take place The same paper had the first police-court hearing of the proceedings against Miss Kitty Winter on the grave charge of vitriol-throwing Such extenuating circumstances came out in the trial that the sentence as will be remembered was the lowest that was possible for such an offence Sherlock Holmes was threatened with a prosecution for burglary but when an object is good and a client is sufficiently illustrious even the rigid British law becomes human and elastic My friend has not yet stood in the dock II THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLANCHED SOLDIER The ideas of my friend Watson though limited are exceedingly pertinacious For a long time he has worried me to write an experience of my own Perhaps I have rather invited this persecution since I have often had occasion to point out to him how superficial are his own accounts and to accuse him of pandering to popular taste instead of confining himself rigidly to facts and figures Try it yourself Holmes he has retorted and I am compelled to admit that having taken my pen in my hand I do begin to realize that the matter must be presented in such a way as may interest the reader The following case can hardly fail to do so as it is among the strangest happenings in my collection though it chanced that Watson had no note of it in his collection Speaking of my old friend and biographer I would take this opportunity to remark that if I burden myself with a companion in my various little inquiries it is not done out of sentiment or caprice but it is that Watson has some remarkable characteristics of his own to which in his modesty he has given small attention amid his exaggerated estimates of my own performances A confederate who foresees your conclusions and course of action is always dangerous but one to whom each development comes as a perpetual surprise and to whom the future is always a closed book is indeed an ideal helpmate I find from my notebook that it was in January 1903 just after the conclusion of the Boer War that I had my visit from Mr James M Dodd a big fresh sunburned upstanding Briton The good Watson had at that time deserted me for a wife the only selfish action which I can recall in our association I was alone It is my habit to sit with my back to the window and to place my visitors in the opposite chair where the light falls full upon them Mr James M Dodd seemed somewhat at a loss how to begin the interview I did not attempt to help him for his silence gave me more time for observation I have found it wise to impress clients with a sense of power and so I gave him some of my conclusions From South Africa sir I perceive Yes sir he answered with some surprise Imperial Yeomanry I fancy Exactly Middlesex Corps no doubt That is so Mr Holmes you are a wizard I smiled at his bewildered expression When a gentleman of virile appearance enters my room with such tan upon his face as an English sun could never give and with his handkerchief in his sleeve instead of in his pocket it is not difficult to place him You wear a short beard which shows that you were not a regular You have the cut of a riding-man As to Middlesex your card has already shown me that you are a stockbroker from Throgmorton Street What other regiment would you join You see everything I see no more than you but I have trained myself to notice what I see However Mr Dodd it was not to discuss the science of observation that you called upon me this morning What has been happening at Tuxbury Old Park Mr Holmes---- My dear sir there is no mystery Your letter came with that heading and as you fixed this appointment in very pressing terms it was clear that something sudden and important had occurred Yes indeed But the letter was written in the afternoon and a good deal has happened since then If Colonel Emsworth had not kicked me out---- Kicked you out Well that was what it amounted to He is a hard nail is Colonel Emsworth The greatest martinet in the Army in his day and it was a day of rough language too I couldn't have stuck the Colonel if it had not been for Godfrey's sake I lit my pipe and leaned back in my chair Perhaps you will explain what you are talking about My client grinned mischievously I had got into the way of supposing that you knew everything without being told said he But I will give you the facts and I hope to God that you will be able to tell me what they mean I've been awake all night puzzling my brain and the more I think the more incredible does it become When I joined up in January 1901--just two years ago--young Godfrey Emsworth had joined the same squadron He was Colonel Emsworth's only son--Emsworth the Crimean VC--and he had the fighting blood in him so it is no wonder he volunteered There was not a finer lad in the regiment We formed a friendship--the sort of friendship which can only be made when one lives the same life and shares the same joys and sorrows He was my mate--and that means a good deal in the Army We took the rough and the smooth together for a year of hard fighting Then he was hit with a bullet from an elephant gun in the action near Diamond Hill outside Pretoria I got one letter from the hospital at Cape Town and one from Southampton Since then not a word--not one word Mr Holmes for six months and more and he my closest pal Well when the war was over and we all got back I wrote to his father and asked where Godfrey was No answer I waited a bit and then I wrote again This time I had a reply short and gruff Godfrey had gone on a voyage round the world and it was not likely that he would be back for a year That was all I wasn't satisfied Mr Holmes The whole thing seemed to me so damned unnatural He was a good lad and he would not drop a pal like that It was not like him Then again I happened to know that he was heir to a lot of money and also that his father and he did not always hit it off too well The old man was sometimes a bully and young Godfrey had too much spirit to stand it No I wasn't satisfied and I determined that I would get to the root of the matter It happened however that my own affairs needed a lot of straightening out after two years' absence and so it is only this week that I have been able to take up Godfrey's case again But since I have taken it up I mean to drop everything in order to see it through Mr James M Dodd appeared to be the sort of person whom it would be better to have as a friend than as an enemy His blue eyes were stern and his square jaw had set hard as he spoke Well what have you done I asked My first move was to get down to his home Tuxbury Old Park near Bedford and to see for myself how the ground lay I wrote to the mother therefore--I had had quite enough of the curmudgeon of a father--and I made a clean frontal attack Godfrey was my chum I had a great deal of interest which I might tell her of our common experiences I should be in the neighbourhood would there be any objection et cetera In reply I had quite an amiable answer from her and an offer to put me up for the night That was what took me down on Monday Tuxbury Old Hall is inaccessible--five miles from anywhere There was no trap at the station so I had to walk carrying my suit-case and it was nearly dark before I arrived It is a great wandering house standing in a considerable park I should judge it was of all sorts of ages and styles starting on a half-timbered Elizabethan foundation and ending in a Victorian portico Inside it was all panelling and tapestry and half-effaced old pictures a house of shadows and mystery There was a butler old Ralph who seemed about the same age as the house and there was his wife who might have been older She had been Godfrey's nurse and I had heard him speak of her as second only to his mother in his affections so I was drawn to her in spite of her queer appearance The mother I liked also--a gentle little white mouse of a woman It was only the Colonel himself whom I barred We had a bit of a barney right away and I should have walked back to the station if I had not felt that it might be playing his game for me to do so I was shown straight into his study and there I found him a huge bow-backed man with a smoky skin and a straggling grey beard seated behind his littered desk A red-veined nose jutted out like a vulture's beak and two fierce grey eyes glared at me from under tufted brows I could understand now why Godfrey seldom spoke of his father 'Well sir' said he in a rasping voice 'I should be interested to know the real reasons for this visit' I answered that I had explained them in my letter to his wife 'Yes yes you said that you had known Godfrey in Africa We have of course only your word for that' 'I have his letters to me in my pocket' 'Kindly let me see them' He glanced at the two which I handed him and then he tossed them back 'Well what then' he asked 'I was fond of your son Godfrey sir Many ties and memories united us Is it not natural that I should wonder at his sudden silence and should wish to know what has become of him' 'I have some recollection sir that I had already corresponded with you and had told you what had become of him He has gone upon a voyage round the world His health was in a poor way after his African experiences and both his mother and I were of opinion that complete rest and change were needed Kindly pass that explanation on to any other friends who may be interested in the matter' 'Certainly' I answered 'But perhaps you would have the goodness to let me have the name of the steamer and of the line by which he sailed together with the date I have no doubt that I should be able to get a letter through to him' My request seemed both to puzzle and to irritate my host His great eyebrows came down over his eyes and he tapped his fingers impatiently on the table He looked up at last with the expression of one who has seen his adversary make a dangerous move at chess and has decided how to meet it 'Many people Mr Dodd' said he 'would take offence at your infernal pertinacity and would think that this insistence had reached the point of damned impertinence' 'You must put it down sir to my real love for your son' 'Exactly I have already made every allowance upon that score I must ask you however to drop these inquiries Every family has its own inner knowledge and its own motives which cannot always be made clear to outsiders however well-intentioned My wife is anxious to hear something of Godfrey's past which you are in a position to tell her but I would ask you to let the present and the future alone Such inquiries serve no useful purpose sir and place us in a delicate and difficult position' So I came to a dead end Mr Holmes There was no getting past it I could only pretend to accept the situation and register a vow inwardly that I would never rest until my friend's fate had been cleared up It was a dull evening We dined quietly the three of us in a gloomy faded old room The lady questioned me eagerly about her son but the old man seemed morose and depressed I was so bored by the whole proceeding that I made an excuse as soon as I decently could and retired to my bedroom It was a large bare room on the ground floor as gloomy as the rest of the house but after a year of sleeping upon the veldt Mr Holmes one is not too particular about one's quarters I opened the curtains and looked out into the garden remarking that it was a fine night with a bright half-moon Then I sat down by the roaring fire with the lamp on a table beside me and endeavoured to distract my mind with a novel I was interrupted however by Ralph the old butler who came in with a fresh supply of coals 'I thought you might run short in the night-time sir It is bitter weather and these rooms are cold' He hesitated before leaving the room and when I looked round he was standing facing me with a wistful look upon his wrinkled face 'Beg your pardon sir but I could not help hearing what you said of young Master Godfrey at dinner You know sir that my wife nursed him and so I may say I am his foster-father It's natural we should take an interest And you say he carried himself well sir' 'There was no braver man in the regiment He pulled me out once from under the rifles of the Boers or maybe I should not be here' The old butler rubbed his skinny hands 'Yes sir yes that is Master Godfrey all over He was always courageous There's not a tree in the park sir that he has not climbed Nothing would stop him He was a fine boy--and oh sir he was a fine man' I sprang to my feet 'Look here' I cried 'You say he was You speak as if he were dead What is all this mystery What has become of Godfrey Emsworth' I gripped the old man by the shoulder but he shrank away 'I don't know what you mean sir Ask the master about Master Godfrey He knows It is not for me to interfere' He was leaving the room but I held his arm 'Listen' I said 'You are going to answer one question before you leave if I have to hold you all night Is Godfrey dead' He could not face my eyes He was like a man hypnotized The answer was dragged from his lips It was a terrible and unexpected one 'I wish to God he was' he cried and tearing himself free he dashed from the room You will think Mr Holmes that I returned to my chair in no very happy state of mind The old man's words seemed to me to bear only one interpretation Clearly my poor friend had become involved in some criminal or at the least disreputable transaction which touched the family honour That stern old man had sent his son away and hidden him from the world lest some scandal should come to light Godfrey was a reckless fellow He was easily influenced by those around him No doubt he had fallen into bad hands and been misled to his ruin It was a piteous business if it was indeed so but even now it was my duty to hunt him out and see if I could aid him I was anxiously pondering the matter when I looked up and there was Godfrey Emsworth standing before me My client had paused as one in deep emotion Pray continue I said Your problem presents some very unusual features He was outside the window Mr Holmes with his face pressed against the glass I have told you that I looked out at the night When I did so I left the curtains partly open His figure was framed in this gap The window came down to the ground and I could see the whole length of it but it was his face which held my gaze He was deadly pale--never have I seen a man so white I reckon ghosts may look like that but his eyes met mine and they were the eyes of a living man He sprang back when he saw that I was looking at him and he vanished into the darkness There was something shocking about the man Mr Holmes It wasn't merely that ghastly face glimmering as white as cheese in the darkness It was more subtle than that--something slinking something furtive something guilty--something very unlike the frank manly lad that I had known It left a feeling of horror in my mind But when a man has been soldiering for a year or two with brother Boer as a playmate he keeps his nerve and acts quickly Godfrey had hardly vanished before I was at the window There was an awkward catch and I was some little time before I could throw it up Then I nipped through and ran down the garden path in the direction that I thought he might have taken It was a long path and the light was not very good but it seemed to me something was moving ahead of me I ran on and called his name but it was no use When I got to the end of the path there were several others branching in different directions to various outhouses I stood hesitating and as I did so I heard distinctly the sound of a closing door It was not behind me in the house but ahead of me somewhere in the darkness That was enough Mr Holmes to assure me that what I had seen was not a vision Godfrey had run away from me and he had shut a door behind him Of that I was certain There was nothing more I could do and I spent an uneasy night turning the matter over in my mind and trying to find some theory which would cover the facts Next day I found the Colonel rather more conciliatory and as his wife remarked that there were some places of interest in the neighbourhood it gave me an opening to ask whether my presence for one more night would incommode them A somewhat grudging acquiescence from the old man gave me a clear day in which to make my observations I was already perfectly convinced that Godfrey was in hiding somewhere near but where and why remained to be solved The house was so large and so rambling that a regiment might be hid away in it and no one the wiser If the secret lay there it was difficult for me to penetrate it But the door which I had heard close was certainly not in the house I must explore the garden and see what I could find There was no difficulty in the way for the old people were busy in their own fashion and left me to my own devices There were several small outhouses but at the end of the garden there was a detached building of some size--large enough for a gardener's or a gamekeeper's residence Could this be the place whence the sound of that shutting door had come I approached it in a careless fashion as though I were strolling aimlessly round the grounds As I did so a small brisk bearded man in a black coat and bowler hat--not at all the gardener type--came out of the door To my surprise he locked it after him and put the key in his pocket Then he looked at me with some surprise on his face 'Are you a visitor here' he asked I explained that I was and that I was a friend of Godfrey's 'What a pity that he should be away on his travels for he would have so liked to see me' I continued 'Quite so Exactly' said he with a rather guilty air 'No doubt you will renew your visit at some more propitious time' He passed on but when I turned I observed that he was standing watching me half-concealed by the laurels at the far end of the garden I had a good look at the little house as I passed it but the windows were heavily curtained and so far as one could see it was empty I might spoil my own game and even be ordered off the premises if I were too audacious for I was still conscious that I was being watched Therefore I strolled back to the house and waited for night before I went on with my inquiry When all was dark and quiet I slipped out of my window and made my way as silently as possible to the mysterious lodge I have said that it was heavily curtained but now I found that the windows were shuttered as well Some light however was breaking through one of them so I concentrated my attention upon this I was in luck for the curtain had not been quite closed and there was a crack in the shutter so that I could see the inside of the room It was a cheery place enough a bright lamp and a blazing fire Opposite to me was seated the little man whom I had seen in the morning He was smoking a pipe and reading a paper What paper I asked My client seemed annoyed at the interruption of his narrative Can it matter he asked It is most essential I really took no notice Possibly you observed whether it was a broad-leafed paper or of that smaller type which one associates with weeklies Now that you mention it it was not large It might have been _The Spectator_ However I had little thought to spare upon such details for a second man was seated with his back to the window and I could swear that this second man was Godfrey I could not see his face but I knew the familiar slope of his shoulders He was leaning upon his elbow in an attitude of great melancholy his body turned towards the fire I was hesitating as to what I should do when there was a sharp tap on my shoulder and there was Colonel Emsworth beside me 'This way sir' said he in a low voice He walked in silence to the house and I followed him into my own bedroom He had picked up a timetable in the hall 'There is a train to London at eight-thirty' said he 'The trap will be at the door at eight' He was white with rage and indeed I felt myself in so difficult a position that I could only stammer out a few incoherent apologies in which I tried to excuse myself by urging my anxiety for my friend 'The matter will not bear discussion' said he abruptly 'You have made a most damnable intrusion into the privacy of our family You were here as a guest and you have become a spy I have nothing more to say sir save that I have no wish ever to see you again' At this I lost my temper Mr Holmes and I spoke with some warmth 'I have seen your son and I am convinced that for some reason of your own you are concealing him from the world I have no idea what your motives are in cutting him off in this fashion but I am sure that he is no longer a free agent I warn you Colonel Emsworth that until I am assured as to the safety and well-being of my friend I shall never desist in my efforts to get to the bottom of the mystery and I shall certainly not allow myself to be intimidated by anything which you may say or do' The old fellow looked diabolical and I really thought he was about to attack me I have said that he was a gaunt fierce old giant and though I am no weakling I might have been hard put to it to hold my own against him However after a long glare of rage he turned upon his heel and walked out of the room For my part I took the appointed train in the morning with the full intention of coming straight to you and asking for your advice and assistance at the appointment for which I had already written Such was the problem which my visitor laid before me It presented as the astute reader will have already perceived few difficulties in its solution for a very limited choice of alternatives must get to the root of the matter Still elementary as it was there were points of interest and novelty about it which may excuse my placing it upon record I now proceeded using my familiar method of logical analysis to narrow down the possible solutions The servants I asked how many were in the house To the best of my belief there were only the old butler and his wife They seemed to live in the simplest fashion There was no servant then in the detached house None unless the little man with the beard acted as such He seemed however to be quite a superior person That seems very suggestive Had you any indication that food was conveyed from the one house to the other Now that you mention it I did see old Ralph carrying a basket down the garden walk and going in the direction of this house The idea of food did not occur to me at the moment Did you make any local inquiries Yes I did I spoke to the station-master and also to the innkeeper in the village I simply asked if they knew anything of my old comrade Godfrey Emsworth Both of them assured me that he had gone for a voyage round the world He had come home and then had almost at once started off again The story was evidently universally accepted You said nothing of your suspicions Nothing That was very wise The matter should certainly be inquired into I will go back with you to Tuxbury Old Park To-day It happened that at the moment I was clearing up the case which my friend Watson has described as that of the Abbey School in which the Duke of Greyminster was so deeply involved I had also a commission from the Sultan of Turkey which called for immediate action as political consequences of the gravest kind might arise from its neglect Therefore it was not until the beginning of the next week as my diary records that I was able to start forth on my mission to Bedfordshire in company with Mr James M Dodd As we drove to Euston we picked up a grave and taciturn gentleman of iron-grey aspect with whom I had made the necessary arrangements This is an old friend said I to Dodd It is possible that his presence may be entirely unnecessary and on the other hand it may be essential It is not necessary at the present stage to go further into the matter The narratives of Watson have accustomed the reader no doubt to the fact that I do not waste words or disclose my thoughts while a case is actually under consideration Dodd seemed surprised but nothing more was said and the three of us continued our journey together In the train I asked Dodd one more question which I wished our companion to hear You say that you saw your friend's face quite clearly at the window so clearly that you are sure of his identity I have no doubt about it whatever His nose was pressed against the glass The lamplight shone full upon him It could not have been someone resembling him No no it was he But you say he was changed Only in colour His face was--how shall I describe it--it was of a fish-belly whiteness It was bleached Was it equally pale all over I think not It was his brow which I saw so clearly as it was pressed against the window Did you call to him I was too startled and horrified for the moment Then I pursued him as I have told you but without result My case was practically complete and there was only one small incident needed to round it off When after a considerable drive we arrived at the strange old rambling house which my client had described it was Ralph the elderly butler who opened the door I had requisitioned the carriage for the day and had asked my elderly friend to remain within it unless we should summon him Ralph a little wrinkled old fellow was in the conventional costume of black coat and pepper-and-salt trousers with only one curious variant He wore brown leather gloves which at sight of us he instantly shuffled off laying them down on the hall-table as we passed in I have as my friend Watson may have remarked an abnormally acute set of senses and a faint but incisive scent was apparent It seemed to centre on the hall-table I turned placed my hat there knocked it off stooped to pick it up and contrived to bring my nose within a foot of the gloves Yes it was undoubtedly from them that the curious tarry odour was oozing I passed on into the study with my case complete Alas that I should have to show my hand so when I tell my own story It was by concealing such links in the chain that Watson was enabled to produce his meretricious finales Colonel Emsworth was not in his room but he came quickly enough on receipt of Ralph's message We heard his quick heavy step in the passage The door was flung open and he rushed in with bristling beard and twisted features as terrible an old man as ever I have seen He held our cards in his hand and he tore them up and stamped on the fragments Have I not told you you infernal busybody that you are warned off the premises Never dare to show your damned face here again If you enter again without my leave I shall be within my rights if I use violence I'll shoot you sir By God I will As to you sir turning upon me I extend the same warning to you I am familiar with your ignoble profession but you must take your reputed talents to some other field There is no opening for them here I cannot leave here said my client firmly until I hear from Godfrey's own lips that he is under no restraint Our involuntary host rang the bell Ralph he said telephone down to the county police and ask the inspector to send up two constables Tell him there are burglars in the house One moment said I You must be aware Mr Dodd that Colonel Emsworth is within his rights and that we have no legal status within his house On the other hand he should recognize that your action is prompted entirely by solicitude for his son I venture to hope that if I were allowed to have five minutes' conversation with Colonel Emsworth I could certainly alter his view of the matter I am not so easily altered said the old soldier Ralph do what I have told you What the devil are you waiting for Ring up the police Nothing of the sort I said putting my back to the door Any police interference would bring about the very catastrophe which you dread I took out my notebook and scribbled one word upon a loose sheet That said I as I handed it to Colonel Emsworth is what has brought us here He stared at the writing with a face from which every expression save amazement had vanished How do you know he gasped sitting down heavily in his chair It is my business to know things That is my trade He sat in deep thought his gaunt hand tugging at his straggling beard Then he made a gesture of resignation Well if you wish to see Godfrey you shall It is no doing of mine but you have forced my hand Ralph tell Mr Godfrey and Mr Kent that in five minutes we shall be with them At the end of that time we passed down the garden path and found ourselves in front of the mystery house at the end A small bearded man stood at the door with a look of considerable astonishment upon his face This is very sudden Colonel Emsworth said he This will disarrange all our plans I can't help it Mr Kent Our hands have been forced Can Mr Godfrey see us Yes he is waiting inside He turned and led us into a large plainly furnished front room A man was standing with his back to the fire and at the sight of him my client sprang forward with outstretched hand Why Godfrey old man this is fine But the other waved him back Don't touch me Jimmie Keep your distance Yes you may well stare I don't quite look the smart Lance-Corporal Emsworth of B Squadron do I His appearance was certainly extraordinary One could see that he had indeed been a handsome man with clear-cut features sunburned by an African sun but mottled in patches over this darker surface were curious whitish patches which had bleached his skin That's why I don't court visitors said he I don't mind you Jimmie but I could have done without your friend I suppose there is some good reason for it but you have me at a disadvantage I wanted to be sure that all was well with you Godfrey I saw you that night when you looked into my window and I could not let the matter rest till I had cleared things up Old Ralph told me you were there and I couldn't help taking a peep at you I hoped you would not have seen me and I had to run to my burrow when I heard the window go up But what in Heaven's name is the matter Well it's not a long story to tell said he lighting a cigarette You remember that morning fight at Buffelsspruit outside Pretoria on the Eastern railway line You heard I was hit Yes I heard that but I never got particulars Three of us got separated from the others It was very broken country you may remember There was Simpson--the fellow we called Baldy Simpson--and Anderson and I We were clearing brother Boer but he lay low and got the three of us The other two were killed I got an elephant bullet through my shoulder I stuck on to my horse however and he galloped several miles before I fainted and rolled off the saddle When I came to myself it was nightfall and I raised myself up feeling very weak and ill To my surprise there was a house close beside me a fairly large house with a broad stoep and many windows It was deadly cold You remember the kind of numb cold which used to come at evening a deadly sickening sort of cold very different from a crisp healthy frost Well I was chilled to the bone and my only hope seemed to lie in reaching that house I staggered to my feet and dragged myself along hardly conscious of what I did I have a dim memory of slowly ascending the steps entering a wide-opened door passing into a large room which contained several beds and throwing myself down with a gasp of satisfaction upon one of them It was unmade but that troubled me not at all I drew the clothes over my shivering body and in a moment I was in a deep sleep It was morning when I wakened and it seemed to me that instead of coming out into a world of sanity I had emerged into some extraordinary nightmare The African sun flooded through the big curtainless windows and every detail of the great bare whitewashed dormitory stood out hard and clear In front of me was standing a small dwarf-like man with a huge bulbous head who was jabbering excitedly in Dutch waving two horrible hands which looked to me like brown sponges Behind him stood a group of people who seemed to be intensely amused by the situation but a chill came over me as I looked at them Not one of them was a normal human being Every one was twisted or swollen or disfigured in some strange way The laughter of these strange monstrosities was a dreadful thing to hear It seemed that none of them could speak English but the situation wanted clearing up for the creature with the big head was growing furiously angry and uttering wild beast cries he had laid his deformed hands upon me and was dragging me out of bed regardless of the fresh flow of blood from my wound The little monster was as strong as a bull and I don't know what he might have done to me had not an elderly man who was clearly in authority been attracted to the room by the hubbub He said a few stern words in Dutch and my persecutor shrank away Then he turned upon me gazing at me in the utmost amazement 'How in the world did you come here' he asked in amazement 'Wait a bit I see that you are tired out and that wounded shoulder of yours wants looking after I am a doctor and I'll soon have you tied up But man alive you are in far greater danger here than ever you were on the battlefield You are in the Leper Hospital and you have slept in a leper's bed' Need I tell you more Jimmie It seems that in view of the approaching battle all these poor creatures had been evacuated the day before Then as the British advanced they had been brought back by this their medical superintendent who assured me that though he believed he was immune to the disease he would none the less never have dared to do what I had done He put me in a private room treated me kindly and within a week or so I was removed to the general hospital at Pretoria So there you have my tragedy I hoped against hope but it was not until I had reached home that the terrible signs which you see upon my face told me that I had not escaped What was I to do I was in this lonely house We had two servants whom we could utterly trust There was a house where I could live Under pledge of secrecy Mr Kent who is a surgeon was prepared to stay with me It seemed simple enough on those lines The alternative was a dreadful one--segregation for life among strangers with never a hope of release But absolute secrecy was necessary or even in this quiet country-side there would have been an outcry and I should have been dragged to my horrible doom Even you Jimmie--even you had to be kept in the dark Why my father has relented I cannot imagine Colonel Emsworth pointed to me This is the gentleman who forced my hand He unfolded the scrap of paper on which I had written the word Leprosy It seemed to me that if he knew so much as that it was safer that he should know all And so it was said I Who knows but good may come of it I understand that only Mr Kent has seen the patient May I ask sir if you are an authority on such complaints which are I understand tropical or semi-tropical in their nature I have the ordinary knowledge of the educated medical man he observed with some stiffness I have no doubt sir that you are fully competent but I am sure that you will agree that in such a case a second opinion is valuable You have avoided this I understand for fear that pressure should be put upon you to segregate the patient That is so said Colonel Emsworth I foresaw this situation I explained and I have brought with me a friend whose discretion may absolutely be trusted I was able once to do him a professional service and he is ready to advise as a friend rather than as a specialist His name is Sir James Saunders The prospect of an interview with Lord Roberts would not have excited greater wonder and pleasure in a raw subaltern than was now reflected upon the face of Mr Kent I shall indeed be proud he murmured Then I will ask Sir James to step this way He is at present in the carriage outside the door Meanwhile Colonel Emsworth we may perhaps assemble in your study where I could give the necessary explanations And here it is that I miss my Watson By cunning questions and ejaculations of wonder he could elevate my simple art which is but systematized common sense into a prodigy When I tell my own story I have no such aid And yet I will give my process of thought even as I gave it to my small audience which included Godfrey's mother in the study of Colonel Emsworth That process said I starts upon the supposition that when you have eliminated all which is impossible then whatever remains however improbable must be the truth It may well be that several explanations remain in which case one tries test after test until one or other of them has a convincing amount of support We will now apply this principle to the case in point As it was first presented to me there were three possible explanations of the seclusion or incarceration of this gentleman in an outhouse of his father's mansion There was the explanation that he was in hiding for a crime or that he was mad and that they wished to avoid an asylum or that he had some disease which caused his segregation I could think of no other adequate solutions These then had to be sifted and balanced against each other The criminal solution would not bear inspection No unsolved crime had been reported from that district I was sure of that If it were some crime not yet discovered then clearly it would be to the interest of the family to get rid of the delinquent and send him abroad rather than keep him concealed at home I could see no explanation for such a line of conduct Insanity was more plausible The presence of the second person in the outhouse suggested a keeper The fact that he locked the door when he came out strengthened the supposition and gave the idea of constraint On the other hand this constraint could not be severe or the young man could not have got loose and come down to have a look at his friend You will remember Mr Dodd that I felt round for points asking you for example about the paper which Mr Kent was reading Had it been _The Lancet_ or _The British Medical Journal_ it would have helped me It is not illegal however to keep a lunatic upon private premises so long as there is a qualified person in attendance and that the authorities have been duly notified Why then all this desperate desire for secrecy Once again I could not get the theory to fit the facts There remained the third possibility into which rare and unlikely as it was everything seemed to fit Leprosy is not uncommon in South Africa By some extraordinary chance this youth might have contracted it His people would be placed in a very dreadful position since they would desire to save him from segregation Great secrecy would be needed to prevent rumours from getting about and subsequent interference by the authorities A devoted medical man if sufficiently paid would easily be found to take charge of the sufferer There would be no reason why the latter should not be allowed freedom after dark Bleaching of the skin is a common result of the disease The case was a strong one--so strong that I determined to act as if it were actually proved When on arriving here I noticed that Ralph who carries out the meals had gloves which are impregnated with disinfectants my last doubts were removed A single word showed you sir that your secret was discovered and if I wrote rather than said it it was to prove to you that my discretion was to be trusted I was finishing this little analysis of the case when the door was opened and the austere figure of the great dermatologist was ushered in But for once his sphinx-like features had relaxed and there was a warm humanity in his eyes He strode up to Colonel Emsworth and shook him by the hand It is often my lot to bring ill-tidings and seldom good said he This occasion is the more welcome It is not leprosy What A well-marked case of pseudo-leprosy or ichthyosis a scale-like affection of the skin unsightly obstinate but possibly curable and certainly non-infective Yes Mr Holmes the coincidence is a remarkable one But is it coincidence Are there not subtle forces at work of which we know little Are we assured that the apprehension from which this young man has no doubt suffered terribly since his exposure to its contagion may not produce a physical effect which simulates that which it fears At any rate I pledge my professional reputation---- But the lady has fainted I think that Mr Kent had better be with her until she recovers from this joyous shock III THE ADVENTURE OF THE MAZARIN STONE It was pleasant to Dr Watson to find himself once more in the untidy room of the first floor in Baker Street which had been the starting-point of so many remarkable adventures He looked round him at the scientific charts upon the wall the acid-charred bench of chemicals the violin-case leaning in the corner the coal-scuttle which contained of old the pipes and tobacco Finally his eyes came round to the fresh and smiling face of Billy the young but very wise and tactful page who had helped a little to fill up the gap of loneliness and isolation which surrounded the saturnine figure of the great detective It all seems very unchanged Billy You don't change either I hope the same can be said of him Billy glanced with some solicitude at the closed door of the bedroom I think he's in bed and asleep he said It was seven in the evening of a lovely summer's day but Dr Watson was sufficiently familiar with the irregularity of his old friend's hours to feel no surprise at the idea That means a case I suppose Yes sir he is very hard at it just now I'm frightened for his health He gets paler and thinner and he eats nothing 'When will you be pleased to dine Mr Holmes' Mrs Hudson asked 'Seven-thirty the day after to-morrow' said he You know his way when he is keen on a case Yes Billy I know He's following someone Yesterday he was out as a workman looking for a job To-day he was an old woman Fairly took me in he did and I ought to know his ways by now Billy pointed with a grin to a very baggy parasol which leaned against the sofa That's part of the old woman's outfit he said But what is it all about Billy Billy sank his voice as one who discusses great secrets of State I don't mind telling you sir but it should go no farther It's this case of the Crown diamond What--the hundred-thousand-pound burglary Yes sir They must get it back sir Why we had the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary both sitting on that very sofa Mr Holmes was very nice to them He soon put them at their ease and promised he would do all he could Then there is Lord Cantlemere---- Ah Yes sir you know what that means He's a stiff 'un sir if I may say so I can get along with the Prime Minister and I've nothing against the Home Secretary who seemed a civil obliging sort of man but I can't stand his lordship Neither can Mr Holmes sir You see he don't believe in Mr Holmes and he was against employing him He'd rather he failed And Mr Holmes knows it Mr Holmes always knows whatever there is to know Well we'll hope he won't fail and that Lord Cantlemere will be confounded But I say Billy what is that curtain for across the window Mr Holmes had it put up there three days ago We've got something funny behind it Billy advanced and drew away the drapery which screened the alcove of the bow window Dr Watson could not restrain a cry of amazement There was a facsimile of his old friend dressing-gown and all the face turned three-quarters towards the window and downwards as though reading an invisible book while the body was sunk deep in an arm-chair Billy detached the head and held it in the air We put it at different angles so that it may seem more life-like I wouldn't dare touch it if the blind were not down But when it's up you can see this from across the way We used something of the sort once before Before my time said Billy He drew the window curtains apart and looked out into the street There are folk who watch us from over yonder I can see a fellow now at the window Have a look for yourself Watson had taken a step forward when the bedroom door opened and the long thin form of Holmes emerged his face pale and drawn but his step and bearing as active as ever With a single spring he was at the window and had drawn the blind once more That will do Billy said he You were in danger of your life then my boy and I can't do without you just yet Well Watson it is good to see you in your old quarters once again You come at a critical moment So I gather You can go Billy That boy is a problem Watson How far am I justified in allowing him to be in danger Danger of what Holmes Of sudden death I'm expecting something this evening Expecting what To be murdered Watson No no you are joking Holmes Even my limited sense of humour could evolve a better joke than that But we may be comfortable in the meantime may we not Is alcohol permitted The gasogene and cigars are in the old place Let me see you once more in the customary arm-chair You have not I hope learned to despise my pipe and my lamentable tobacco It has to take the place of food these days But why not eat Because the faculties become refined when you starve them Why surely as a doctor my dear Watson you must admit that what your digestion gains in the way of blood supply is so much lost to the brain I am a brain Watson The rest of me is a mere appendix Therefore it is the brain I must consider But this danger Holmes Ah yes in case it should come off it would perhaps be as well that you should burden your memory with the name and address of the murderer You can give it to Scotland Yard with my love and a parting blessing Sylvius is the name--Count Negretto Sylvius Write it down man write it down 136 Moorside Gardens NW Got it Watson's honest face was twitching with anxiety He knew only too well the immense risks taken by Holmes and was well aware that what he said was more likely to be under-statement than exaggeration Watson was always the man of action and he rose to the occasion Count me in Holmes I have nothing to do for a day or two Your morals don't improve Watson You have added fibbing to your other vices You bear every sign of the busy medical man with calls on him every hour Not such important ones But can't you have this fellow arrested Yes Watson I could That's what worries him so But why don't you Because I don't know where the diamond is Ah Billy told me--the missing Crown jewel Yes the great yellow Mazarin stone I've cast my net and I have my fish But I have not got the stone What is the use of taking _them_ We can make the world a better place by laying them by the heels But that is not what I am out for It's the stone I want And is this Count Sylvius one of your fish Yes and he's a shark He bites The other is Sam Merton the boxer Not a bad fellow Sam but the Count has used him Sam's not a shark He is a great big silly bull-headed gudgeon But he is flopping about in my net all the same Where is this Count Sylvius I've been at his very elbow all the morning You've seen me as an old lady Watson I was never more convincing He actually picked up my parasol for me once 'By your leave madame' said he--half-Italian you know and with the Southern graces of manner when in the mood but a devil incarnate in the other mood Life is full of whimsical happenings Watson It might have been tragedy Well perhaps it might I followed him to old Straubenzee's workshop in the Minories Straubenzee made the air-gun--a very pretty bit of work as I understand and I rather fancy it is in the opposite window at the present moment Have you seen the dummy Of course Billy showed it to you Well it may get a bullet through its beautiful head at any moment Ah Billy what is it The boy had reappeared in the room with a card upon a tray Holmes glanced at it with raised eyebrows and an amused smile The man himself I had hardly expected this Grasp the nettle Watson A man of nerve Possibly you have heard of his reputation as a shooter of big game It would indeed be a triumphant ending to his excellent sporting record if he added me to his bag This is a proof that he feels my toe very close behind his heel Send for the police I probably shall But not just yet Would you glance carefully out of the window Watson and see if anyone is hanging about in the street Watson looked warily round the edge of the curtain Yes there is one rough fellow near the door That will be Sam Merton--the faithful but rather fatuous Sam Where is this gentleman Billy In the waiting-room sir Show him up when I ring Yes sir If I am not in the room show him in all the same Yes sir Watson waited until the door was closed and then he turned earnestly to his companion Look here Holmes this is simply impossible This is a desperate man who sticks at nothing He may have come to murder you I should not be surprised I insist upon staying with you You would be horribly in the way In his way No my dear fellow--in my way Well I can't possibly leave you Yes you can Watson And you will for you have never failed to play the game I am sure you will play it to the end This man has come for his own purpose but he may stay for mine Holmes took out his notebook and scribbled a few lines Take a cab to Scotland Yard and give this to Youghal of the CID Come back with the police The fellow's arrest will follow I'll do that with joy Before you return I may have just time enough to find out where the stone is He touched the bell I think we will go out through the bedroom This second exit is exceedingly useful I rather want to see my shark without his seeing me and I have as you will remember my own way of doing it It was therefore an empty room into which Billy a minute later ushered Count Sylvius The famous game-shot sportsman and man-about-town was a big swarthy fellow with a formidable dark moustache shading a cruel thin-lipped mouth and surmounted by a long curved nose like the beak of an eagle He was well dressed but his brilliant necktie shining pin and glittering rings were flamboyant in their effect As the door closed behind him he looked round him with fierce startled eyes like one who suspects a trap at every turn Then he gave a violent start as he saw the impassive head and the collar of the dressing-gown which projected above the arm-chair in the window At first his expression was one of pure amazement Then the light of a horrible hope gleamed in his dark murderous eyes He took one more glance round to see that there were no witnesses and then on tiptoe his thick stick half raised he approached the silent figure He was crouching for his final spring and blow when a cool sardonic voice greeted him from the open bedroom door Don't break it Count Don't break it The assassin staggered back amazement in his convulsed face For an instant he half raised his loaded cane once more as if he would turn his violence from the effigy to the original but there was something in that steady grey eye and mocking smile which caused his hand to sink to his side It's a pretty little thing said Holmes advancing towards the image Tavernier the French modeller made it He is as good at waxworks as your friend Straubenzee is at air-guns Air-guns sir What do you mean Put your hat and stick on the side-table Thank you Pray take a seat Would you care to put your revolver out also Oh very good if you prefer to sit upon it Your visit is really most opportune for I wanted badly to have a few minutes' chat with you The Count scowled with heavy threatening eyebrows I too wished to have some words with you Holmes That is why I am here I won't deny that I intended to assault you just now Holmes swung his leg on the edge of the table I rather gathered that you had some idea of the sort in your head said he But why these personal attentions Because you have gone out of your way to annoy me Because you have put your creatures upon my track My creatures I assure you no Nonsense I have had them followed Two can play at that game Holmes It is a small point Count Sylvius but perhaps you would kindly give me my prefix when you address me You can understand that with my routine of work I should find myself on familiar terms with half the rogues' gallery and you will agree that exceptions are invidious Well _Mr_ Holmes then Excellent But I assure you you are mistaken about my alleged agents Count Sylvius laughed contemptuously Other people can observe as well as you Yesterday there was an old sporting man To-day it was an elderly woman They held me in view all day Really sir you compliment me Old Baron Dowson said the night before he was hanged that in my case what the law had gained the stage had lost And now you give my little impersonations your kindly praise It was you--you yourself Holmes shrugged his shoulders You can see in the corner the parasol which you so politely handed to me in the Minories before you began to suspect If I had known you might never---- Have seen this humble home again I was well aware of it We all have neglected opportunities to deplore As it happens you did not know so here we are The Count's knotted brows gathered more heavily over his menacing eyes What you say only makes the matter worse It was not your agents but your play-acting busybody self You admit that you have dogged me Why Come now Count You used to shoot lions in Algeria Well But why Why The sport--the excitement--the danger And no doubt to free the country from a pest Exactly My reasons in a nutshell The Count sprang to his feet and his hand involuntarily moved back to his hip-pocket Sit down sir sit down There was another more practical reason I want that yellow diamond Count Sylvius lay back in his chair with an evil smile Upon my word said he You knew that I was after you for that The real reason why you are here to-night is to find out how much I know about the matter and how far my removal is absolutely essential Well I should say that from your point of view it is absolutely essential for I know all about it save only one thing which you are about to tell me Oh indeed And pray what is this missing fact Where the Crown diamond now is The Count looked sharply at his companion Oh you want to know that do you How the devil should I be able to tell you where it is You can and you will Indeed You can't bluff me Count Sylvius Holmes's eyes as he gazed at him contracted and lightened until they were like two menacing points of steel You are absolute plate-glass I see to the very back of your mind Then of course you see where the diamond is Holmes clapped his hands with amusement and then pointed a derisive finger Then you do know You have admitted it I admit nothing Now Count if you will be reasonable we can do business If not you will get hurt Count Sylvius threw up his eyes to the ceiling And you talk about bluff said he Holmes looked at him thoughtfully like a master chess-player who meditates his crowning move Then he threw open the table drawer and drew out a squat notebook Do you know what I keep in this book No sir I do not You Me Yes sir _you_ You are all here--every action of your vile and dangerous life Damn you Holmes cried the Count with blazing eyes There are limits to my patience It's all here Count The real facts as to the death of old Mrs Harold who left you the Blymer estate which you so rapidly gambled away You are dreaming And the complete life history of Miss Minnie Warrender Tut You will make nothing of that Plenty more here Count Here is the robbery in the train-de-luxe to the Riviera on February 13 1892 Here is the forged cheque in the same year on the Crédit Lyonnais No you're wrong there Then I am right on the others Now Count you are a card-player When the other fellow has all the trumps it saves time to throw down your hand What has all this talk to do with the jewel of which you spoke Gently Count Restrain that eager mind Let me get to the points in my own humdrum fashion I have all this against you but above all I have a clear case against both you and your fighting bully in the case of the Crown diamond Indeed I have the cabman who took you to Whitehall and the cabman who brought you away I have the Commissionaire who saw you near the case I have Ikey Sanders who refused to cut it up for you Ikey has peached and the game is up The veins stood out on the Count's forehead His dark hairy hands were clenched in a convulsion of restrained emotion He tried to speak but the words would not shape themselves That's the hand I play from said Holmes I put it all upon the table But one card is missing It's the King of Diamonds I don't know where the stone is You never shall know No Now be reasonable Count Consider the situation You are going to be locked up for twenty years So is Sam Merton What good are you going to get out of your diamond None in the world But if you hand it over--well I'll compound a felony We don't want you or Sam We want the stone Give that up and so far as I am concerned you can go free so long as you behave yourself in the future If you make another slip--well it will be the last But this time my commission is to get the stone not you But if I refuse Why then--alas--it must be you and not the stone Billy had appeared in answer to a ring I think Count that it would be as well to have your friend Sam at this conference After all his interests should be represented Billy you will see a large and ugly gentleman outside the front door Ask him to come up If he won't come sir No violence Billy Don't be rough with him If you tell him that Count Sylvius wants him he will certainly come What are you going to do now asked the Count as Billy disappeared My friend Watson was with me just now I told him that I had a shark and a gudgeon in my net now I am drawing the net and up they come together The Count had risen from his chair and his hand was behind his back Holmes held something half protruding from the pocket of his dressing-gown You won't die in your bed Holmes I have often had the same idea Does it matter very much After all Count your own exit is more likely to be perpendicular than horizontal But these anticipations of the future are morbid Why not give ourselves up to the unrestrained enjoyment of the present A sudden wild-beast light sprang up in the dark menacing eyes of the master criminal Holmes's figure seemed to grow taller as he grew tense and ready It is no use your fingering your revolver my friend he said in a quiet voice You know perfectly well that you dare not use it even if I gave you time to draw it Nasty noisy things revolvers Count Better stick to air-guns Ah I think I hear the fairy footstep of your estimable partner Good day Mr Merton Rather dull in the street is it not The prize-fighter a heavily built young man with a stupid obstinate slab-sided face stood awkwardly at the door looking about him with a puzzled expression Holmes's debonair manner was a new experience and though he vaguely felt that it was hostile he did not know how to counter it He turned to his more astute comrade for help What's the game now Count What's this fellow want What's up His voice was deep and raucous The Count shrugged his shoulders and it was Holmes who answered If I may put it in a nutshell Mr Merton I should say it was _all_ up The boxer still addressed his remarks to his associate Is this cove trying to be funny or what I'm not in the funny mood myself No I expect not said Holmes I think I can promise you that you will feel even less humorous as the evening advances Now look here Count Sylvius I'm a busy man and I can't waste time I'm going into that bedroom Pray make yourselves quite at home in my absence You can explain to your friend how the matter lies without the restraint of my presence I shall try over the Hoffmann Barcarolle upon my violin In five minutes I shall return for your final answer You quite grasp the alternative do you not Shall we take you or shall we have the stone Holmes withdrew picking up his violin from the corner as he passed A few moments later the long-drawn wailing notes of that most haunting of tunes came faintly through the closed door of the bedroom What is it then asked Merton anxiously as his companion turned to him Does he know about the stone He knows a damned sight too much about it I'm not sure that he doesn't know all about it Good Lord The boxer's sallow face turned a shade whiter Ikey Sanders has split on us He has has he I'll do him down a thick 'un for that if I swing for it That won't help us much We've got to make up our minds what to do Half a mo' said the boxer looking suspiciously at the bedroom door He's a leary cove that wants watching I suppose he's not listening How can he be listening with that music going That's right Maybe somebody's behind a curtain Too many curtains in this room As he looked round he suddenly saw for the first time the effigy in the window and stood staring and pointing too amazed for words Tut it's only a dummy said the Count A fake is it Well strike me Madame Tussaud ain't in it It's the living spit of him gown and all But them curtains Count Oh confound the curtains We are wasting our time and there is none too much He can lag us over this stone The deuce he can But he'll let us slip if we only tell him where the swag is What Give it up Give up a hundred thousand quid It's one or the other Merton scratched his short-cropped pate He's alone in there Let's do him in If his light were out we should have nothing to fear The Count shook his head He is armed and ready If we shot him we could hardly get away in a place like this Besides it's likely enough that the police know whatever evidence he has got Hallo What was that There was a vague sound which seemed to come from the window Both men sprang round but all was quiet Save for the one strange figure seated in the chair the room was certainly empty Something in the street said Merton Now look here guv'nor you've got the brains Surely you can think a way out of it If slugging is no use then it's up to you I've fooled better men than he the Count answered The stone is here in my secret pocket I take no chances leaving it about It can be out of England to-night and cut into four pieces in Amsterdam before Sunday He knows nothing of Van Seddar I thought Van Seddar was going next week He _was_ But now he must get off by the next boat One or other of us must slip round with the stone to Lime Street and tell him But the false bottom ain't ready Well he must take it as it is and chance it There's not a moment to lose Again with the sense of danger which becomes an instinct with the sportsman he paused and looked hard at the window Yes it was surely from the street that the faint sound had come As to Holmes he continued we can fool him easily enough You see the damned fool won't arrest us if he can get the stone Well we'll promise him the stone We'll put him on the wrong track about it and before he finds that it is the wrong track it will be in Holland and we out of the country That sounds good to me cried Sam Merton with a grin You go on and tell the Dutchman to get a move on him I'll see this sucker and fill him up with a bogus confession I'll tell him that the stone is in Liverpool Confound that whining music it gets on my nerves By the time he finds it isn't in Liverpool it will be in quarters and we on the blue water Come back here out of a line with that keyhole Here is the stone I wonder you dare carry it Where could I have it safer If we could take it out of Whitehall someone else could surely take it out of my lodgings Let's have a look at it Count Sylvius cast a somewhat unflattering glance at his associate and disregarded the unwashed hand which was extended towards him What--d'ye think I'm going to snatch it off you See here mister I'm getting a bit tired of your ways Well well no offence Sam We can't afford to quarrel Come over to the window if you want to see the beauty properly Now hold it to the light Here Thank you With a single spring Holmes had leaped from the dummy's chair and had grasped the precious jewel He held it now in one hand while his other pointed a revolver at the Count's head The two villains staggered back in utter amazement Before they had recovered Holmes had pressed the electric bell No violence gentlemen--no violence I beg of you Consider the furniture It must be very clear to you that your position is an impossible one The police are waiting below The Count's bewilderment overmastered his rage and fear But how the deuce---- he gasped Your surprise is very natural You are not aware that a second door from my bedroom leads behind that curtain I fancied that you must have heard me when I displaced the figure but luck was on my side It gave me a chance of listening to your racy conversation which would have been painfully constrained had you been aware of my presence The Count gave a gesture of resignation We give you best Holmes I believe you are the devil himself Not far from him at any rate Holmes answered with a polite smile Sam Merton's slow intellect had only gradually appreciated the situation Now as the sound of heavy steps came from the stairs outside he broke silence at last A fair cop said he But I say what about that bloomin' fiddle I hear it yet Tut tut Holmes answered You are perfectly right Let it play These modern gramophones are a remarkable invention There was an inrush of police the handcuffs clicked and the criminals were led to the waiting cab Watson lingered with Holmes congratulating him upon this fresh leaf added to his laurels Once more their conversation was interrupted by the imperturbable Billy with his card-tray Lord Cantlemere sir Show him up Billy This is the eminent peer who represents the very highest interests said Holmes He is an excellent and loyal person but rather of the old regime Shall we make him unbend Dare we venture upon a slight liberty He knows we may conjecture nothing of what has occurred The door opened to admit a thin austere figure with a hatchet face and drooping mid-Victorian whiskers of a glossy blackness which hardly corresponded with the rounded shoulders and feeble gait Holmes advanced affably and shook an unresponsive hand How-do-you-do Lord Cantlemere It is chilly for the time of year but rather warm indoors May I take your overcoat No I thank you I will not take it off Holmes laid his hand insistently upon the sleeve Pray allow me My friend Dr Watson would assure you that these changes of temperature are most insidious His lordship shook himself free with some impatience I am quite comfortable sir I have no need to stay I have simply looked in to know how your self-appointed task was progressing It is difficult--very difficult I feared that you would find it so There was a distinct sneer in the old courtier's words and manner Every man finds his limitations Mr Holmes but at least it cures us of the weakness of self-satisfaction Yes sir I have been much perplexed No doubt Especially upon one point Possibly you could help me upon it You apply for my advice rather late in the day I thought that you had your own all-sufficient methods Still I am ready to help you You see Lord Cantlemere we can no doubt frame a case against the actual thieves When you have caught them Exactly But the question is--how shall we proceed against the receiver Is this not rather premature It is as well to have our plans ready Now what would you regard as final evidence against the receiver The actual possession of the stone You would arrest him upon that Most undoubtedly Holmes seldom laughed but he got as near it as his old friend Watson could remember In that case my dear sir I shall be under the painful necessity of advising your arrest Lord Cantlemere was very angry Some of the ancient fires flickered up into his sallow cheeks You take a great liberty Mr Holmes In fifty years of official life I cannot recall such a case I am a busy man sir engaged upon important affairs and I have no time or taste for foolish jokes I may tell you frankly sir that I have never been a believer in your powers and that I have always been of the opinion that the matter was far safer in the hands of the regular police force Your conduct confirms all my conclusions I have the honour sir to wish you good evening Holmes had swiftly changed his position and was between the peer and the door One moment sir said he To actually go off with the Mazarin stone would be a more serious offence than to be found in temporary possession of it Sir this is intolerable Let me pass Put your hand in the right-hand pocket of your overcoat What do you mean sir Come--come do what I ask An instant later the amazed peer was standing blinking and stammering with the great yellow stone on his shaking palm What What How is this Mr Holmes Too bad Lord Cantlemere too bad cried Holmes My old friend here will tell you that I have an impish habit of practical joking Also that I can never resist a dramatic situation I took the liberty--the very great liberty I admit--of putting the stone into your pocket at the beginning of our interview The old peer stared from the stone to the smiling face before him Sir I am bewildered But--yes--it is indeed the Mazarin stone We are greatly your debtors Mr Holmes Your sense of humour may as you admit be somewhat perverted and its exhibition remarkably untimely but at least I withdraw any reflection I have made upon your amazing professional powers But how---- The case is but half finished the details can wait No doubt Lord Cantlemere your pleasure in telling of this successful result in the exalted circle to which you return will be some small atonement for my practical joke Billy you will show his lordship out and tell Mrs Hudson that I should be glad if she would send up dinner for two as soon as possible IV THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE GABLES I don't think that any of my adventures with Mr Sherlock Holmes opened quite so abruptly or so dramatically as that which I associate with The Three Gables I had not seen Holmes for some days and had no idea of the new channel into which his activities had been directed He was in a chatty mood that morning however and had just settled me into the well-worn low arm-chair on one side of the fire while he had curled down with his pipe in his mouth upon the opposite chair when our visitor arrived If I had said that a mad bull had arrived it would give a clearer impression of what occurred The door had flown open and a huge negro had burst into the room He would have been a comic figure if he had not been terrific for he was dressed in a very loud grey check suit with a flowing salmon-coloured tie His broad face and flattened nose were thrust forward as his sullen dark eyes with a smouldering gleam of malice in them turned from one of us to the other Which of you genelmen is Masser Holmes he asked Holmes raised his pipe with a languid smile Oh it's you is it said our visitor coming with an unpleasant stealthy step round the angle of the table See here Masser Holmes you keep your hands out of other folks' business Leave folks to manage their own affairs Got that Masser Holmes Keep on talking said Holmes It's fine Oh it's fine is it growled the savage It won't be so damn fine if I have to trim you up a bit I've handled your kind before now and they didn't look fine when I was through with them Look at that Masser Holmes He swung a huge knotted lump of a fist under my friend's nose Holmes examined it closely with an air of great interest Were you born so he asked Or did it come by degrees It may have been the icy coolness of my friend or it may have been the slight clatter which I made as I picked up the poker In any case our visitor's manner became less flamboyant Well I've given you fair warnin' said he I've a friend that's interested out Harrow way--you know what I'm meaning--and he don't intend to have no buttin' in by you Got that You ain't the law and I ain't the law either and if you come in I'll be on hand also Don't you forget it I've wanted to meet you for some time said Holmes I won't ask you to sit down for I don't like the smell of you but aren't you Steve Dixie the bruiser That's my name Masser Holmes and you'll get put through it for sure if you give me any lip It is certainly the last thing you need said Holmes staring at our visitor's hideous mouth But it was the killing of young Perkins outside the Holborn Bar---- What you're not going The negro had sprung back and his face was leaden I won't listen to no such talk said he What have I to do with this 'ere Perkins Masser Holmes I was trainin' at the Bull Ring in Birmingham when this boy done gone get into trouble Yes you'll tell the magistrate about it Steve said Holmes I've been watching you and Barney Stockdale---- So help me the Lord Masser Holmes---- That's enough Get out of it I'll pick you up when I want you Good mornin' Masser Holmes I hope there ain't no hard feelin's about this 'ere visit There will be unless you tell me who sent you Why there ain't no secret about that Masser Holmes It was that same genelman that you have just done gone mention And who set him on to it S'elp me I don't know Masser Holmes He just say 'Steve you go see Mr Holmes and tell him his life ain't safe if he go down Harrow way' That's the whole truth Without waiting for any further questioning our visitor bolted out of the room almost as precipitately as he had entered Holmes knocked out the ashes of his pipe with a quiet chuckle I am glad you were not forced to break his woolly head Watson I observed your manoeuvres with the poker But he is really rather a harmless fellow a great muscular foolish blustering baby and easily cowed as you have seen He is one of the Spencer John gang and has taken part in some dirty work of late which I may clear up when I have time His immediate principal Barney is a more astute person They specialize in assaults intimidation and the like What I want to know is who is at the back of them on this particular occasion But why do they want to intimidate you It is this Harrow Weald case It decides me to look into the matter for if it is worth anyone's while to take so much trouble there must be something in it But what is it I was going to tell you when we had this comic interlude Here is Mrs Maberley's note If you care to come with me we will wire her and go out at once DEAR MR SHERLOCK HOLMES I read-- I have had a succession of strange incidents occur to me in connection with this house and I should much value your advice You would find me at home any time to-morrow The house is within a short walk of the Weald Station I believe that my late husband Mortimer Maberley was one of your early clients Yours faithfully MARY MABERLEY The address was The Three Gables Harrow Weald So that's that said Holmes And now if you can spare the time Watson we will get upon our way A short railway journey and a shorter drive brought us to the house a brick and timber villa standing in its own acre of undeveloped grassland Three small projections above the upper windows made a feeble attempt to justify its name Behind was a grove of melancholy half-grown pines and the whole aspect of the place was poor and depressing None the less we found the house to be well furnished and the lady who received us was a most engaging elderly person who bore every mark of refinement and culture I remember your husband well madam said Holmes though it is some years since he used my services in some trifling matter Probably you would be more familiar with the name of my son Douglas Holmes looked at her with great interest Dear me Are you the mother of Douglas Maberley I knew him slightly But of course all London knew him What a magnificent creature he was Where is he now Dead Mr Holmes dead He was Attaché at Rome and he died there of pneumonia last month I am sorry One could not connect death with such a man I have never known anyone so vitally alive He lived intensely--every fibre of him Too intensely Mr Holmes That was the ruin of him You remember him as he was--debonair and splendid You did not see the moody morose brooding creature into which he developed His heart was broken In a single month I seemed to see my gallant boy turn into a worn-out cynical man A love affair--a woman Or a fiend Well it was not to talk of my poor lad that I asked you to come Mr Holmes Dr Watson and I are at your service There have been some very strange happenings I have been in this house more than a year now and as I wished to lead a retired life I have seen little of my neighbours Three days ago I had a call from a man who said that he was a house agent He said that this house would exactly suit a client of his and that if I would part with it money would be no object It seemed to me very strange as there are several empty houses on the market which appear to be equally eligible but naturally I was interested in what he said I therefore named a price which was five hundred pounds more than I gave He at once closed with the offer but added that his client desired to buy the furniture as well and would I put a price upon it Some of this furniture is from my old home and it is as you see very good so that I named a good round sum To this also he at once agreed I had always wanted to travel and the bargain was so good a one that it really seemed that I should be my own mistress for the rest of my life Yesterday the man arrived with the agreement all drawn out Luckily I showed it to Mr Sutro my lawyer who lives in Harrow He said to me 'This is a very strange document Are you aware that if you sign it you could not legally take _anything_ out of the house--not even your own private possessions' When the man came again in the evening I pointed this out and I said that I meant only to sell the furniture 'No no everything' said he 'But my clothes My jewels' 'Well well some concession might be made for your personal effects But nothing shall go out of the house unchecked My client is a very liberal man but he has his fads and his own way of doing things It is everything or nothing with him' 'Then it must be nothing' said I And there the matter was left but the whole thing seemed to me to be so unusual that I thought---- Here we had a very extraordinary interruption Holmes raised his hand for silence Then he strode across the room flung open the door and dragged in a great gaunt woman whom he had seized by the shoulder She entered with ungainly struggles like some huge awkward chicken torn squawking out of its coop Leave me alone What are you a-doin' of she screeched Why Susan what is this Well ma'am I was comin' in to ask if the visitors was stayin' for lunch when this man jumped out at me I have been listening to her for the last five minutes but did not wish to interrupt your most interesting narrative Just a little wheezy Susan are you not You breathe too heavily for that kind of work Susan turned a sulky but amazed face upon her captor Who be you anyhow and what right have you a-pullin' me about like this It was merely that I wished to ask a question in your presence Did you Mrs Maberley mention to anyone that you were going to write to me and consult me No Mr Holmes I did not Who posted your letter Susan did Exactly Now Susan to whom was it that you wrote or sent a message to say that your mistress was asking advice from me It's a lie I sent no message Now Susan wheezy people may not live long you know It's a wicked thing to tell fibs Whom did you tell Susan cried her mistress I believe you are a bad treacherous woman I remember now that I saw you speaking to someone over the hedge That was my own business said the woman sullenly Suppose I tell you that it was Barney Stockdale to whom you spoke said Holmes Well if you know what do you want to ask for I was not sure but I know now Well now Susan it will be worth ten pounds to you if you will tell me who is at the back of Barney Someone that could lay down a thousand pounds for every ten you have in the world So a rich man No you smiled--a rich woman Now we have got so far you may as well give the name and earn the tenner I'll see you in hell first Oh Susan Language I am clearing out of here I've had enough of you all I'll send for my box to-morrow She flounced for the door Good-bye Susan Paregoric is the stuff Now he continued turning suddenly from lively to severe when the door had closed behind the flushed and angry woman this gang means business Look how close they play the game Your letter to me had the 10 pm postmark And yet Susan passes the word to Barney Barney has time to go to his employer and get instructions he or she--I incline to the latter from Susan's grin when she thought I had blundered--forms a plan Black Steve is called in and I am warned off by eleven o'clock next morning That's quick work you know But what do they want Yes that's the question Who had the house before you A retired sea captain called Ferguson Anything remarkable about him Not that ever I heard of I was wondering whether he could have buried something Of course when people bury treasure nowadays they do it in the Post Office bank But there are always some lunatics about It would be a dull world without them At first I thought of some buried valuable But why in that case should they want your furniture You don't happen to have a Raphael or a first folio Shakespeare without knowing it No I don't think I have anything rarer than a Crown Derby tea-set That would hardly justify all this mystery Besides why should they not openly state what they want If they covet your tea-set they can surely offer a price for it without buying you out lock stock and barrel No as I read it there is something which you do not know that you have and which you would not give up if you did know That is how I read it said I Dr Watson agrees so that settles it Well Mr Holmes what can it be Let us see whether by this purely mental analysis we can get it to a finer point You have been in this house a year Nearly two All the better During this long period no one wants anything from you Now suddenly within three or four days you have urgent demands What would you gather from that It can only mean said I that the object whatever it may be has only just come into the house Settled once again said Holmes Now Mrs Maberley has any object just arrived No I have bought nothing new this year Indeed That is very remarkable Well I think we had best let matters develop a little further until we have clearer data Is that lawyer of yours a capable man Mr Sutro is most capable Have you another maid or was the fair Susan who has just banged your front door alone I have a young girl Try and get Sutro to spend a night or two in the house You might possibly want protection Against whom Who knows The matter is certainly obscure If I can't find what they are after I must approach the matter from the other end and try to get at the principal Did this house-agent man give any address Simply his card and occupation Haines-Johnson Auctioneer and Valuer I don't think we shall find him in the Directory Honest business men don't conceal their place of business Well you will let me know any fresh development I have taken up your case and you may rely upon it that I shall see it through As we passed through the hall Holmes's eyes which missed nothing lighted upon several trunks and cases which were piled in the corner The labels shone out upon them 'Milano' 'Lucerne' These are from Italy They are poor Douglas's things You have not unpacked them How long have you had them They arrived last week But you said--why surely this might be the missing link How do we know that there is not something of value there There could not possibly be Mr Holmes Poor Douglas had only his pay and a small annuity What could he have of value Holmes was lost in thought Delay no longer Mrs Maberley he said at last Have these things taken upstairs to your bedroom Examine them as soon as possible and see what they contain I will come to-morrow and hear your report It was quite evident that The Three Gables was under very close surveillance for as we came round the high hedge at the end of the lane there was the negro prize-fighter standing in the shadow We came on him quite suddenly and a grim and menacing figure he looked in that lonely place Holmes clapped his hand to his pocket Lookin' for your gun Masser Holmes No for my scent-bottle Steve You are funny Masser Holmes ain't you It won't be funny for you Steve if I get after you I gave you fair warning this morning Well Masser Holmes I done gone think over what you said and I don't want no more talk about that affair of Masser Perkins S'pose I can help you Masser Holmes I will Well then tell me who is behind you on this job So help me the Lord Masser Holmes I told you the truth before I don't know My boss Barney gives me orders and that's all Well just bear in mind Steve that the lady in that house and everything under that roof is under my protection Don't you forget it All right Masser Holmes I'll remember' I've got him thoroughly frightened for his own skin Watson Holmes remarked as we walked on I think he would double-cross his employer if he knew who he was It was lucky I had some knowledge of the Spencer John crowd and that Steve was one of them Now Watson this is a case for Langdale Pike and I am going to see him now When I get back I may be clearer in the matter I saw no more of Holmes during the day but I could well imagine how he spent it for Langdale Pike was his human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal This strange languid creature spent his waking hours in the bow window of a St James's Street club and was the receiving-station as well as the transmitter for all the gossip of the Metropolis He made it was said a four-figure income by the paragraphs which he contributed every week to the garbage papers which cater for an inquisitive public If ever far down in the turbid depths of London life there was some strange swirl or eddy it was marked with automatic exactness by this human dial upon the surface Holmes discreetly helped Langdale to knowledge and on occasion was helped in turn When I met my friend in his room early next morning I was conscious from his bearing that all was well but none the less a most unpleasant surprise was awaiting us It took the shape of the following telegram Please come out at once Client's house burgled in the night Police in possession SUTRO Holmes whistled The drama has come to a crisis and quicker than I had expected There is a great driving-power at the back of this business Watson which does not surprise me after what I have heard This Sutro of course is her lawyer I made a mistake I fear in not asking you to spend the night on guard This fellow has clearly proved a broken reed Well there is nothing for it but another journey to Harrow Weald We found The Three Gables a very different establishment to the orderly household of the previous day A small group of idlers had assembled at the garden gate while a couple of constables were examining the windows and the geranium beds Within we met a grey old gentleman who introduced himself as the lawyer together with a bustling rubicund Inspector who greeted Holmes as an old friend Well Mr Holmes no chance for you in this case I'm afraid Just a common ordinary burglary and well within the capacity of the poor old police No experts need apply I am sure the case is in very good hands said Holmes Merely a common burglary you say Quite so We know pretty well who the men are and where to find them It is that gang of Barney Stockdale with the big nigger in it--they've been seen about here Excellent What did they get Well they don't seem to have got much Mrs Maberley was chloroformed and the house was---- Ah here is the lady herself Our friend of yesterday looking very pale and ill had entered the room leaning upon a little maid-servant You gave me good advice Mr Holmes said she smiling ruefully Alas I did not take it I did not wish to trouble Mr Sutro and so I was unprotected I only heard of it this morning the lawyer explained Mr Holmes advised me to have some friend in the house I neglected his advice and I have paid for it You look wretchedly ill said Holmes Perhaps you are hardly equal to telling me what occurred It is all here said the Inspector tapping a bulky notebook Still if the lady is not too exhausted---- There is really so little to tell I have no doubt that wicked Susan had planned an entrance for them They must have known the house to an inch I was conscious for a moment of the chloroform rag which was thrust over my mouth but I have no notion how long I may have been senseless When I woke one man was at the bedside and another was rising with a bundle in his hand from among my son's baggage which was partially opened and littered over the floor Before he could get away I sprang up and seized him You took a big risk said the Inspector I clung to him but he shook me off and the other may have struck me for I can remember no more Mary the maid heard the noise and began screaming out of the window That brought the police but the rascals had got away What did they take Well I don't think there is anything of value missing I am sure there was nothing in my son's trunks Did the men leave no clue There was one sheet of paper which I may have torn from the man that I grasped It was lying all crumpled on the floor It is in my son's handwriting Which means that it is not of much use said the Inspector Now if it had been in the burglar's---- Exactly said Holmes What rugged common sense None the less I should be curious to see it The Inspector drew a folded sheet of foolscap from his pocket-book I never pass anything however trifling said he with some pomposity That is my advice to you Mr Holmes In twenty-five years' experience I have learned my lesson There is always the chance of finger-marks or something Holmes inspected the sheet of paper What do you make of it Inspector Seems to be the end of some queer novel so far as I can see It may certainly prove to be the end of a queer tale said Holmes You have noticed the number on the top of the page It is two hundred and forty-five Where are the odd two hundred and forty-four pages Well I suppose the burglars got those Much good may it do them It seems a queer thing to break into a house in order to steal such papers as that Does it suggest anything to you Inspector Yes sir it suggests that in their hurry the rascals just grabbed at what came first to hand I wish them joy of what they got Why should they go to my son's things asked Mrs Maberley Well they found nothing valuable downstairs so they tried their luck upstairs That is how I read it What do you make of it Mr Holmes I must think it over Inspector Come to the window Watson Then as we stood together he read over the fragment of paper It began in the middle of a sentence and ran like this face bled considerably from the cuts and blows but it was nothing to the bleeding of his heart as he saw that lovely face the face for which he had been prepared to sacrifice his very life looking out at his agony and humiliation She smiled--yes by Heaven she smiled like the heartless fiend she was as he looked up at her It was at that moment that love died and hate was born Man must live for something If it is not for your embrace my lady then it shall surely be for your undoing and my complete revenge Queer grammar said Holmes with a smile as he handed the paper back to the Inspector Did you notice how the 'he' suddenly changed to 'my' The writer was so carried away by his own story that he imagined himself at the supreme moment to be the hero It seemed mighty poor stuff said the Inspector as he replaced it in his book What are you off Mr Holmes I don't think there is anything more for me to do now that the case is in such capable hands By the way Mrs Maberley did you say you wished to travel It has always been my dream Mr Holmes Where would you like to go--Cairo Madeira the Riviera Oh if I had the money I would go round the world Quite so Round the world Well good morning I may drop you a line in the evening As we passed the window I caught a glimpse of the Inspector's smile and shake of the head These clever fellows have always a touch of madness That was what I read in the Inspector's smile Now Watson we are at the last lap of our little journey said Holmes when we were back in the roar of Central London once more I think we had best clear the matter up at once and it would be well that you should come with me for it is safer to have a witness when you are dealing with such a lady as Isadora Klein We had taken a cab and were speeding to some address in Grosvenor Square Holmes had been sunk in thought but he roused himself suddenly By the way Watson I suppose you see it all clearly No I can't say that I do I only gather that we are going to see the lady who is behind all this mischief Exactly But does the name Isadora Klein convey nothing to you She was of course the celebrated beauty There was never a woman to touch her She is pure Spanish the real blood of the masterful Conquistadors and her people have been leaders in Pernambuco for generations She married the aged German sugar king Klein and presently found herself the richest as well as the most lovely widow upon earth Then there was an interval of adventure when she pleased her own tastes She had several lovers and Douglas Maberley one of the most striking men in London was one of them It was by all accounts more than an adventure with him He was not a Society butterfly but a strong proud man who gave and expected all But she is the '_belle dame sans merci_' of fiction When her caprice is satisfied the matter is ended and if the other party in the matter can't take her word for it she knows how to bring it home to him Then that was his own story---- Ah you are piecing it together now I hear that she is about to marry the young Duke of Lomond who might almost be her son His Grace's ma might overlook the age but a big scandal would be a different matter so it is imperative---- Ah here we are It was one of the finest corner-houses of the West End A machine-like footman took up our cards and returned with word that the lady was not at home Then we shall wait until she is said Holmes cheerfully The machine broke down Not at home means not at home to _you_ said the footman Good Holmes answered That means that we shall not have to wait Kindly give this note to your mistress He scribbled three or four words upon a sheet of his notebook folded it and handed it to the man What did you say Holmes I asked I simply wrote 'Shall it be the police then' I think that should pass us in It did--with amazing celerity A minute later we were in an Arabian-nights' drawing-room vast and wonderful in a half gloom picked out with an occasional pink electric light The lady had come I felt to that time of life when even the proudest beauty finds the half-light more welcome She rose from a settee as we entered tall queenly a perfect figure a lovely mask-like face with two wonderful Spanish eyes which looked murder at us both What is this intrusion--and this insulting message she asked holding up the slip of paper I need not explain madame I have too much respect for your intelligence to do so--though I confess that intelligence has been surprisingly at fault of late How so sir By supposing that your hired bullies could frighten me from my work Surely no man would take up my profession if it were not that danger attracts him It was you then who forced me to examine the case of young Maberley I have no idea what you are talking about What have I to do with hired bullies Holmes turned away wearily Yes I have underrated your intelligence Well good afternoon Stop Where are you going To Scotland Yard We had not got half-way to the door before she had overtaken us and was holding his arm She had turned in a moment from steel to velvet Come and sit down gentlemen Let us talk this matter over I feel that I may be frank with you Mr Holmes You have the feelings of a gentleman How quick a woman's instinct is to find it out I will treat you as a friend I cannot promise to reciprocate madame I am not the law but I represent justice so far as my feeble powers go I am ready to listen and then I will tell you how I will act No doubt it was foolish of me to threaten a brave man like yourself What was really foolish madame is that you have placed yourself in the power of a band of rascals who may blackmail or give you away No no I am not so simple Since I have promised to be frank I may say that no one save Barney Stockdale and Susan his wife have the least idea who their employer is As to them well it is not the first---- She smiled and nodded with a charming coquettish intimacy I see You've tested them before They are good hounds who run silent Such hounds have a way sooner or later of biting the hand that feeds them They will be arrested for this burglary The police are already after them They will take what comes to them That is what they are paid for I shall not appear in the matter Unless I bring you into it No no you would not You are a gentleman It is a woman's secret In the first place you must give back this manuscript She broke into a ripple of laughter and walked to the fireplace There was a calcined mass which she broke up with the poker Shall I give this back she asked So roguish and exquisite did she look as she stood before us with a challenging smile that I felt of all Holmes's criminals this was the one whom he would find it hardest to face However he was immune from sentiment That seals your fate he said coldly You are very prompt in your actions madame but you have overdone it on this occasion She threw the poker down with a clatter How hard you are she cried May I tell you the whole story I fancy I could tell it to you But you must look at it with my eyes Mr Holmes You must realize it from the point of view of a woman who sees all her life's ambition about to be ruined at the last moment Is such a woman to be blamed if she protects herself The original sin was yours Yes yes I admit it He was a dear boy Douglas but it so chanced that he could not fit into my plans He wanted marriage--marriage Mr Holmes--with a penniless commoner Nothing less would serve him Then he became pertinacious Because I had given he seemed to think that I still must give and to him only It was intolerable At last I had to make him realize it By hiring ruffians to beat him under your own window You do indeed seem to know everything Well it is true Barney and the boys drove him away and were I admit a little rough in doing so But what did he do then Could I have believed that a gentleman would do such an act He wrote a book in which he described his own story I of course was the wolf he the lamb It was all there under different names of course but who in all London would have failed to recognize it What do you say to that Mr Holmes Well he was within his rights It was as if the air of Italy had got into his blood and brought with it the old cruel Italian spirit He wrote to me and sent me a copy of his book that I might have the torture of anticipation There were two copies he said--one for me one for his publisher How did you know the publisher's had not reached him I knew who his publisher was It is not his only novel you know I found out that he had not heard from Italy Then came Douglas's sudden death So long as that other manuscript was in the world there was no safety for me Of course it must be among his effects and these would be returned to his mother I set the gang at work One of them got into the house as servant I wanted to do the thing honestly I really and truly did I was ready to buy the house and everything in it I offered any price she cared to ask I only tried the other way when everything else had failed Now Mr Holmes granting that I was too hard on Douglas--and God knows I am sorry for it--what else could I do with my whole future at stake Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders Well well said he I suppose I shall have to compound a felony as usual How much does it cost to go round the world in first-class style The lady stared in amazement Could it be done on five thousand pounds Well I should think so indeed Very good I think you will sign me a cheque for that and I will see that it comes to Mrs Maberley You owe her a little change of air Meantime lady--he wagged a cautionary forefinger--have a care Have a care You can't play with edged tools for ever without cutting those dainty hands V THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE Holmes had read carefully a note which the last post had brought him Then with the dry chuckle which was his nearest approach to a laugh he tossed it over to me For a mixture of the modern and the mediæval of the practical and of the wildly fanciful I think this is surely the limit said he What do you make of it Watson I read as follows 46 OLD JEWRY _Nov_ 19_th_ _Re_ Vampires SIR-- Our client Mr Robert Ferguson of Ferguson and Muirhead tea brokers of Mincing Lane has made some inquiry from us in a communication of even date concerning vampires As our firm specializes entirely upon the assessment of machinery the matter hardly comes within our purview and we have therefore recommended Mr Ferguson to call upon you and lay the matter before you We have not forgotten your successful action in the case of Matilda Briggs We are Sir Faithfully yours MORRISON MORRISON AND DODD per E J C Matilda Briggs was not the name of a young woman Watson said Holmes in a reminiscent voice It was a ship which is associated with the giant rat of Sumatra a story for which the world is not yet prepared But what do we know about vampires Does it come within our purview either Anything is better than stagnation but really we seem to have been switched on to a Grimm's fairy tale Make a long arm Watson and see what V has to say I leaned back and took down the great index volume to which he referred Holmes balanced it on his knee and his eyes moved slowly and lovingly over the record of old cases mixed with the accumulated information of a lifetime Voyage of the Gloria Scott he read That was a bad business I have some recollection that you made a record of it Watson though I was unable to congratulate you upon the result Victor Lynch the forger Venomous lizard or gila Remarkable case that Vittoria the circus belle Vanderbilt and the Yeggman Vipers Vigor the Hammersmith wonder Hullo Hullo Good old index You can't beat it Listen to this Watson Vampirism in Hungary And again Vampires in Transylvania He turned over the pages with eagerness but after a short intent perusal he threw down the great book with a snarl of disappointment Rubbish Watson rubbish What have we to do with walking corpses who can only be held in their grave by stakes driven through their hearts It's pure lunacy But surely said I the vampire was not necessarily a dead man A living person might have the habit I have read for example of the old sucking the blood of the young in order to retain their youth You are right Watson It mentions the legend in one of these references But are we to give serious attention to such things This Agency stands flat-footed upon the ground and there it must remain The world is big enough for us No ghosts need apply I fear that we cannot take Mr Robert Ferguson very seriously Possibly this note may be from him and may throw some light upon what is worrying him He took up a second letter which had lain unnoticed upon the table whilst he had been absorbed with the first This he began to read with a smile of amusement upon his face which gradually faded away into an expression of intense interest and concentration When he had finished he sat for some little time lost in thought with the letter dangling from his fingers Finally with a start he aroused himself from his reverie Cheeseman's Lamberley Where is Lamberley Watson It is in Sussex south of Horsham Not very far eh And Cheeseman's I know that country Holmes It is full of old houses which are named after the men who built them centuries ago You get Odley's and Harvey's and Carriton's--the folk are forgotten but their names live in their houses Precisely said Holmes coldly It was one of the peculiarities of his proud self-contained nature that though he docketed any fresh information very quickly and accurately in his brain he seldom made any acknowledgment to the giver I rather fancy we shall know a good deal more about Cheeseman's Lamberley before we are through The letter is as I had hoped from Robert Ferguson By the way he claims acquaintance with you With me You had better read it He handed the letter across It was headed with the address quoted DEAR MR HOLMES it said--I have been recommended to you by my lawyers but indeed the matter is so extraordinarily delicate that it is most difficult to discuss It concerns a friend for whom I am acting This gentleman married some five years ago a Peruvian lady the daughter of a Peruvian merchant whom he had met in connection with the importation of nitrates The lady was very beautiful but the fact of her foreign birth and of her alien religion always caused a separation of interests and of feelings between husband and wife so that after a time his love may have cooled towards her and he may have come to regard their union as a mistake He felt there were sides of her character which he could never explore or understand This was the more painful as she was as loving a wife as a man could have--to all appearance absolutely devoted Now for the point which I will make more plain when we meet Indeed this note is merely to give you a general idea of the situation and to ascertain whether you would care to interest yourself in the matter The lady began to show some curious traits quite alien to her ordinarily sweet and gentle disposition The gentleman had been married twice and he had one son by the first wife This boy was now fifteen a very charming and affectionate youth though unhappily injured through an accident in childhood Twice the wife was caught in the act of assaulting this poor lad in the most unprovoked way Once she struck him with a stick and left a great weal on his arm This was a small matter however compared with her conduct to her own child a dear boy just under one year of age On one occasion about a month ago this child had been left by its nurse for a few minutes A loud cry from the baby as of pain called the nurse back As she ran into the room she saw her employer the lady leaning over the baby and apparently biting his neck There was a small wound in the neck from which a stream of blood had escaped The nurse was so horrified that she wished to call the husband but the lady implored her not to do so and actually gave her five pounds as a price for her silence No explanation was ever given and for the moment the matter was passed over It left however a terrible impression upon the nurse's mind and from that time she began to watch her mistress closely and to keep a closer guard upon the baby whom she tenderly loved It seemed to her that even as she watched the mother so the mother watched her and that every time she was compelled to leave the baby alone the mother was waiting to get at it Day and night the nurse covered the child and day and night the silent watchful mother seemed to be lying in wait as a wolf waits for a lamb It must read most incredible to you and yet I beg you to take it seriously for a child's life and a man's sanity may depend upon it At last there came one dreadful day when the facts could no longer be concealed from the husband The nurse's nerve had given way she could stand the strain no longer and she made a clean breast of it all to the man To him it seemed as wild a tale as it may now seem to you He knew his wife to be a loving wife and save for the assaults upon her stepson a loving mother Why then should she wound her own dear little baby He told the nurse that she was dreaming that her suspicions were those of a lunatic and that such libels upon her mistress were not to be tolerated Whilst they were talking a sudden cry of pain was heard Nurse and master rushed together to the nursery Imagine his feelings Mr Holmes as he saw his wife rise from a kneeling position beside the cot and saw blood upon the child's exposed neck and upon the sheet With a cry of horror he turned his wife's face to the light and saw blood all round her lips It was she--she beyond all question--who had drunk the poor baby's blood So the matter stands She is now confined to her room There has been no explanation The husband is half demented He knows and I know little of Vampirism beyond the name We had thought it was some wild tale of foreign parts And yet here in the very heart of the English Sussex--well all this can be discussed with you in the morning Will you see me Will you use your great powers in aiding a distracted man If so kindly wire to Ferguson Cheeseman's Lamberley and I will be at your rooms by ten o'clock Yours faithfully ROBERT FERGUSON PS--I believe your friend Watson played Rugby for Blackheath when I was three-quarter for Richmond It is the only personal introduction which I can give Of course I remember him said I as I laid down the letter Big Bob Ferguson the finest three-quarter Richmond ever had He was always a good-natured chap It's like him to be so concerned over a friend's case Holmes looked at me thoughtfully and shook his head I never get your limits Watson said he There are unexplored possibilities about you Take a wire down like a good fellow 'Will examine your case with pleasure' _Your_ case We must not let him think that this Agency is a home for the weak-minded Of course it is his case Send him that wire and let the matter rest till morning Promptly at ten o'clock next morning Ferguson strode into our room I had remembered him as a long slab-sided man with loose limbs and a fine turn of speed which had carried him round many an opposing back There is surely nothing in life more painful than to meet the wreck of a fine athlete whom one has known in his prime His great frame had fallen in his flaxen hair was scanty and his shoulders were bowed I fear that I roused corresponding emotions in him Hullo Watson said he and his voice was still deep and hearty You don't look quite the man you did when I threw you over the ropes into the crowd at the Old Deer Park I expect I have changed a bit also But it's this last day or two that has aged me I see by your telegram Mr Holmes that it is no use my pretending to be anyone's deputy It is simpler to deal direct said Holmes Of course it is But you can imagine how difficult it is when you are speaking of the one woman whom you are bound to protect and help What can I do How am I to go to the police with such a story And yet the kiddies have got to be protected Is it madness Mr Holmes Is it something in the blood Have you any similar case in your experience For God's sake give me some advice for I am at my wits' end Very naturally Mr Ferguson Now sit here and pull yourself together and give me a few clear answers I can assure you that I am very far from being at my wits' end and that I am confident we shall find some solution First of all tell me what steps you have taken Is your wife still near the children We had a dreadful scene She is a most loving woman Mr Holmes If ever a woman loved a man with all her heart and soul she loves me She was cut to the heart that I should have discovered this horrible this incredible secret She would not even speak She gave no answer to my reproaches save to gaze at me with a sort of wild despairing look in her eyes Then she rushed to her room and locked herself in Since then she has refused to see me She has a maid who was with her before her marriage Dolores by name--a friend rather than a servant She takes her food to her Then the child is in no immediate danger Mrs Mason the nurse has sworn that she will not leave it night or day I can absolutely trust her I am more uneasy about poor little Jack for as I told you in my note he has twice been assaulted by her But never wounded No she struck him savagely It is the more terrible as he is a poor little inoffensive cripple Ferguson's gaunt features softened as he spoke of his boy You would think that the dear lad's condition would soften anyone's heart A fall in childhood and a twisted spine Mr Holmes But the dearest most loving heart within Holmes had picked up the letter of yesterday and was reading it over What other inmates are there in your house Mr Ferguson Two servants who have not been long with us One stable-hand Michael who sleeps in the house My wife myself my boy Jack baby Dolores and Mrs Mason That is all I gather that you did not know your wife well at the time of your marriage I had only known her a few weeks How long had this maid Dolores been with her Some years Then your wife's character would really be better known by Dolores than by you Yes you may say so Holmes made a note I fancy said he that I may be of more use at Lamberley than here It is eminently a case for personal investigation If the lady remains in her room our presence could not annoy or inconvenience her Of course we would stay at the inn Ferguson gave a gesture of relief It is what I hoped Mr Holmes There is an excellent train at two from Victoria if you could come Of course we could come There is a lull at present I can give you my undivided energies Watson of course comes with us But there are one or two points upon which I wish to be very sure before I start This unhappy lady as I understand it has appeared to assault both the children her own baby and your little son That is so But the assaults take different forms do they not She has beaten your son Once with a stick and once very savagely with her hands Did she give no explanation why she struck him None save that she hated him Again and again she said so Well that is not unknown among stepmothers A posthumous jealousy we will say Is the lady jealous by nature Yes she is very jealous--jealous with all the strength of her fiery tropical love But the boy--he is fifteen I understand and probably very developed in mind since his body has been circumscribed in action Did he give you no explanation of these assaults No he declared there was no reason Were they good friends at other times No there was never any love between them Yet you say he is affectionate Never in the world could there be so devoted a son My life is his life He is absorbed in what I say or do Once again Holmes made a note For some time he sat lost in thought No doubt you and the boy were great comrades before this second marriage You were thrown very close together were you not Very much so And the boy having so affectionate a nature was devoted no doubt to the memory of his mother Most devoted He would certainly seem to be a most interesting lad There is one other point about these assaults Were the strange attacks upon the baby and the assaults upon your son at the same period In the first case it was so It was as if some frenzy had seized her and she had vented her rage upon both In the second case it was only Jack who suffered Mrs Mason had no complaint to make about the baby That certainly complicates matters I don't quite follow you Mr Holmes Possibly not One forms provisional theories and waits for time or fuller knowledge to explode them A bad habit Mr Ferguson but human nature is weak I fear that your old friend here has given an exaggerated view of my scientific methods However I will only say at the present stage that your problem does not appear to me to be insoluble and that you may expect to find us at Victoria at two o'clock It was evening of a dull foggy November day when having left our bags at the Chequers Lamberley we drove through the Sussex clay of a long winding lane and finally reached the isolated and ancient farm-house in which Ferguson dwelt It was a large straggling building very old in the centre very new at the wings with towering Tudor chimneys and a lichen-spotted high-pitched roof of Horsham slabs The doorsteps were worn into curves and the ancient tiles which lined the porch were marked with the rebus of a cheese and a man after the original builder Within the ceilings were corrugated with heavy oaken beams and the uneven floors sagged into sharp curves An odour of age and decay pervaded the whole crumbling building There was one very large central room into which Ferguson led us Here in a huge old-fashioned fireplace with an iron screen behind it dated 1670 there blazed and spluttered a splendid log fire The room as I gazed round was a most singular mixture of dates and of places The half-panelled walls may well have belonged to the original yeoman farmer of the seventeenth century They were ornamented however on the lower part by a line of well-chosen modern water-colours while above where yellow plaster took the place of oak there was hung a fine collection of South American utensils and weapons which had been brought no doubt by the Peruvian lady upstairs Holmes rose with that quick curiosity which sprang from his eager mind and examined them with some care He returned with his eyes full of thought Hullo he cried Hullo A spaniel had lain in a basket in the corner It came slowly forward towards its master walking with difficulty Its hind-legs moved irregularly and its tail was on the ground It licked Ferguson's hand What is it Mr Holmes The dog What's the matter with it That's what puzzled the vet A sort of paralysis Spinal meningitis he thought But it is passing He'll be all right soon--won't you Carlo A shiver of assent passed through the drooping tail The dog's mournful eyes passed from one of us to the other He knew that we were discussing his case Did it come on suddenly In a single night How long ago It may have been four months ago Very remarkable Very suggestive What do you see in it Mr Holmes A confirmation of what I had already thought For God's sake what do you think Mr Holmes It may be a mere intellectual puzzle to you but it is life and death to me My wife a would-be murderer--my child in constant danger Don't play with me Mr Holmes It is too terribly serious The big Rugby three-quarter was trembling all over Holmes put his hand soothingly upon his arm I fear that there is pain for you Mr Ferguson whatever the solution may be said he I would spare you all I can I cannot say more for the instant but before I leave this house I hope I may have something definite Please God you may If you will excuse me gentlemen I will go up to my wife's room and see if there has been any change He was away some minutes during which Holmes resumed his examination of the curiosities upon the wall When our host returned it was clear from his downcast face that he had made no progress He brought with him a tall slim brown-faced girl The tea is ready Dolores said Ferguson See that your mistress has everything she can wish She verra ill cried the girl looking with indignant eyes at her master She no ask for food She verra ill She need doctor I frightened stay alone with her without doctor Ferguson looked at me with a question in his eyes I should be so glad if I could be of use Would your mistress see Dr Watson I take him I no ask leave She needs doctor Then I'll come with you at once I followed the girl who was quivering with strong emotion up the staircase and down an ancient corridor At the end was an iron-clamped and massive door It struck me as I looked at it that if Ferguson tried to force his way to his wife he would find it no easy matter The girl drew a key from her pocket and the heavy oaken planks creaked upon their old hinges I passed in and she swiftly followed fastening the door behind her On the bed a woman was lying who was clearly in a high fever She was only half conscious but as I entered she raised a pair of frightened but beautiful eyes and glared at me in apprehension Seeing a stranger she appeared to be relieved and sank back with a sigh upon the pillow I stepped up to her with a few reassuring words and she lay still while I took her pulse and temperature Both were high and yet my impression was that the condition was rather that of mental and nervous excitement than of any actual seizure She lie like that one day two day I 'fraid she die said the girl The woman turned her flushed and handsome face towards me Where is my husband He is below and would wish to see you I will not see him I will not see him Then she seemed to wander off into delirium A fiend A fiend Oh what shall I do with this devil Can I help you in any way No No one can help It is finished All is destroyed Do what I will all is destroyed The woman must have some strange delusion I could not see honest Bob Ferguson in the character of fiend or devil Madame I said your husband loves you dearly He is deeply grieved at this happening Again she turned on me those glorious eyes He loves me Yes But do I not love him Do I not love him even to sacrifice myself rather than break his dear heart That is how I love him And yet he could think of me--he could speak of me so He is full of grief but he cannot understand No he cannot understand But he should trust Will you not see him I suggested No no I cannot forget those terrible words nor the look upon his face I will not see him Go now You can do nothing for me Tell him only one thing I want my child I have a right to my child That is the only message I can send him She turned her face to the wall and would say no more I returned to the room downstairs where Ferguson and Holmes still sat by the fire Ferguson listened moodily to my account of the interview How can I send her the child he said How do I know what strange impulse might come upon her How can I ever forget how she rose from beside it with its blood upon her lips He shuddered at the recollection The child is safe with Mrs Mason and there he must remain A smart maid the only modern thing which we had seen in the house had brought in some tea As she was serving it the door opened and a youth entered the room He was a remarkable lad pale-faced and fair-haired with excitable light blue eyes which blazed into a sudden flame of emotion and joy as they rested upon his father He rushed forward and threw his arms round his neck with the abandon of a loving girl Oh daddy he cried I did not know that you were due yet I should have been here to meet you Oh I am so glad to see you Ferguson gently disengaged himself from the embrace with some little show of embarrassment Dear old chap said he patting the flaxen head with a very tender hand I came early because my friends Mr Holmes and Dr Watson have been persuaded to come down and spend an evening with us Is that Mr Holmes the detective Yes The youth looked at us with a very penetrating and as it seemed to me unfriendly gaze What about your other child Mr Ferguson asked Holmes Might we make the acquaintance of the baby Ask Mrs Mason to bring baby down said Ferguson The boy went off with a curious shambling gait which told my surgical eyes that he was suffering from a weak spine Presently he returned and behind him came a tall gaunt woman bearing in her arms a very beautiful child dark-eyed golden-haired a wonderful mixture of the Saxon and the Latin Ferguson was evidently devoted to it for he took it into his arms and fondled it most tenderly Fancy anyone having the heart to hurt him he muttered as he glanced down at the small angry red pucker upon the cherub throat It was at this moment that I chanced to glance at Holmes and saw a most singular intentness in his expression His face was as set as if it had been carved out of old ivory and his eyes which had glanced for a moment at father and child were now fixed with eager curiosity upon something at the other side of the room Following his gaze I could only guess that he was looking out through the window at the melancholy dripping garden It is true that a shutter had half closed outside and obstructed the view but none the less it was certainly at the window that Holmes was fixing his concentrated attention Then he smiled and his eyes came back to the baby On its chubby neck there was this small puckered mark Without speaking Holmes examined it with care Finally he shook one of the dimpled fists which waved in front of him Good-bye little man You have made a strange start in life Nurse I should wish to have a word with you in private He took her aside and spoke earnestly for a few minutes I only heard the last words which were Your anxiety will soon I hope be set at rest The woman who seemed to be a sour silent kind of creature withdrew with the child What is Mrs Mason like asked Holmes Not very prepossessing externally as you can see but a heart of gold and devoted to the child Do you like her Jack Holmes turned suddenly upon the boy His expressive mobile face shadowed over and he shook his head Jacky has very strong likes and dislikes said Ferguson putting his arm round the boy Luckily I am one of his likes The boy cooed and nestled his head upon his father's breast Ferguson gently disengaged him Run away little Jacky said he and he watched his son with loving eyes until he disappeared Now Mr Holmes he continued when the boy was gone I really feel that I have brought you on a fool's errand for what can you possibly do save give me your sympathy It must be an exceedingly delicate and complex affair from your point of view It is certainly delicate said my friend with an amused smile but I have not been struck up to now with its complexity It has been a case for intellectual deduction but when this original intellectual deduction is confirmed point by point by quite a number of independent incidents then the subjective becomes objective and we can say confidently that we have reached our goal I had in fact reached it before we left Baker Street and the rest has merely been observation and confirmation Ferguson put his big hand to his furrowed forehead For Heaven's sake Holmes he said hoarsely if you can see the truth in this matter do not keep me in suspense How do I stand What shall I do I care nothing as to how you have found your facts so long as you have really got them Certainly I owe you an explanation and you shall have it But you will permit me to handle the matter in my own way Is the lady capable of seeing us Watson She is ill but she is quite rational Very good It is only in her presence that we can clear the matter up Let us go up to her She will not see me cried Ferguson Oh yes she will said Holmes He scribbled a few lines upon a sheet of paper You at least have the _entrée_ Watson Will you have the goodness to give the lady this note I ascended again and handed the note to Dolores who cautiously opened the door A minute later I heard a cry from within a cry in which joy and surprise seemed to be blended Dolores looked out She will see them She will leesten said she At my summons Ferguson and Holmes came up As we entered the room Ferguson took a step or two towards his wife who had raised herself in the bed but she held out her hand to repulse him He sank into an arm-chair while Holmes seated himself beside him after bowing to the lady who looked at him with wide-eyed amazement I think we can dispense with Dolores said Holmes Oh very well madame if you would rather she stayed I can see no objection Now Mr Ferguson I am a busy man with many calls and my methods have to be short and direct The swiftest surgery is the least painful Let me first say what will ease your mind Your wife is a very good a very loving and a very ill-used woman Ferguson sat up with a cry of joy Prove that Mr Holmes and I am your debtor for ever I will do so but in doing so I must wound you deeply in another direction I care nothing so long as you clear my wife Everything on earth is insignificant compared to that Let me tell you then the train of reasoning which passed through my mind in Baker Street The idea of a vampire was to me absurd Such things do not happen in criminal practice in England And yet your observation was precise You had seen the lady rise from beside the child's cot with the blood upon her lips I did Did it not occur to you that a bleeding wound may be sucked for some other purpose than to draw the blood from it Was there not a Queen in English history who sucked such a wound to draw poison from it Poison A South American household My instinct felt the presence of those weapons upon the wall before my eyes ever saw them It might have been other poison but that was what occurred to me When I saw that little empty quiver beside the small bird-bow it was just what I expected to see If the child were pricked with one of those arrows dipped in curare or some other devilish drug it would mean death if the venom were not sucked out And the dog If one were to use such a poison would one not try it first in order to see that it had not lost its power I did not foresee the dog but at least I understood him and he fitted into my reconstruction Now do you understand Your wife feared such an attack She saw it made and saved the child's life and yet she shrank from telling you all the truth for she knew how you loved the boy and feared lest it break your heart Jacky I watched him as you fondled the child just now His face was clearly reflected in the glass of the window where the shutter formed a background I saw such jealousy such cruel hatred as I have seldom seen in a human face My Jacky You have to face it Mr Ferguson It is the more painful because it is a distorted love a maniacal exaggerated love for you and possibly for his dead mother which has prompted his action His very soul is consumed with hatred for this splendid child whose health and beauty are a contrast to his own weakness Good God It is incredible Have I spoken the truth madame The lady was sobbing with her face buried in the pillows Now she turned to her husband How could I tell you Bob I felt the blow it would be to you It was better that I should wait and that it should come from some other lips than mine When this gentleman who seems to have powers of magic wrote that he knew all I was glad I think a year at sea would be my prescription for Master Jacky said Holmes rising from his chair Only one thing is still clouded madame We can quite understand your attacks upon Master Jacky There is a limit to a mother's patience But how did you dare to leave the child these last two days I had told Mrs Mason She knew Exactly So I imagined Ferguson was standing by the bed choking his hands outstretched and quivering This I fancy is the time for our exit Watson said Holmes in a whisper If you will take one elbow of the too faithful Dolores I will take the other There now he added as he closed the door behind him I think we may leave them to settle the rest among themselves I have only one further note of this case It is the letter which Holmes wrote in final answer to that with which the narrative begins It ran thus BAKER STREET _Nov_ 21st _Re_ Vampires SIR-- Referring to your letter of the 19th I beg to state that I have looked into the inquiry of your client Mr Robert Ferguson of Ferguson and Muirhead tea brokers of Mincing Lane and that the matter has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion With thanks for your recommendation I am Sir Faithfully yours SHERLOCK HOLMES VI THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE GARRIDEBS It may have been a comedy or it may have been a tragedy It cost one man his reason it cost me a blood-letting and it cost yet another man the penalties of the law Yet there was certainly an element of comedy Well you shall judge for yourselves I remember the date very well for it was in the same month that Holmes refused a knighthood for services which may perhaps some day be described I only refer to the matter in passing for in my position of partner and confidant I am obliged to be particularly careful to avoid any indiscretion I repeat however that this enables me to fix the date which was the latter end of June 1902 shortly after the conclusion of the South African War Holmes had spent several days in bed as was his habit from time to time but he emerged that morning with a long foolscap document in his hand and a twinkle of amusement in his austere grey eyes There is a chance for you to make some money friend Watson said he Have you ever heard the name of Garrideb I admitted that I had not Well if you can lay your hand upon a Garrideb there's money in it Why Ah that's a long story--rather a whimsical one too I don't think in all our explorations of human complexities we have ever come upon anything more singular The fellow will be here presently for cross-examination so I won't open the matter up till he comes But meanwhile that's the name we want The telephone directory lay on the table beside me and I turned over the pages in a rather hopeless quest But to my amazement there was this strange name in its due place I gave a cry of triumph Here you are Holmes Here it is Holmes took the book from my hand 'Garrideb N' he read '136 Little Ryder Street W' Sorry to disappoint you my dear Watson but this is the man himself That is the address upon his letter We want another to match him Mrs Hudson had come in with a card upon a tray I took it up and glanced at it Why here it is I cried in amazement This is a different initial John Garrideb Counsellor at Law Moorville Kansas USA Holmes smiled as he looked at the card I am afraid you must make yet another effort Watson said he This gentleman is also in the plot already though I certainly did not expect to see him this morning However he is in a position to tell us a good deal which I want to know A moment later he was in the room Mr John Garrideb Counsellor at Law was a short powerful man with the round fresh clean-shaven face characteristic of so many American men of affairs The general effect was chubby and rather childlike so that one received the impression of quite a young man with a broad set smile upon his face His eyes however were arresting Seldom in any human head have I seen a pair which bespoke a more intense inward life so bright were they so alert so responsive to every change of thought His accent was American but was not accompanied by any eccentricity of speech Mr Holmes he asked glancing from one to the other Ah yes Your pictures are not unlike you sir if I may say so I b\""

       "\"the adventure of the illustrious client it can't hurt now was mr sherlock holmes's comment when for the tenth time in as many years i asked his leave to reveal the following narrative so it was that at last i obtained permission to put on record what was in some ways the supreme moment of my friend's career both holmes and i had a weakness for the turkish bath it was over a smoke in the pleasant lassitude of the drying-room that i have found him less reticent and more human than anywhere else on the upper floor of the northumberland avenue establishment there is an isolated corner where two couches lie side by side and it was on these that we lay upon september 3 1902 the day when my narrative begins i had asked him whether anything was stirring and for answer he had shot his long thin nervous arm out of the sheets which enveloped him and had drawn an envelope from the inside pocket of the coat which hung beside him it may be some fussy self-important fool it may be a matter of life or death said he as he handed me the note i know no more than this message tells me it was from the carlton club and dated the evening before this is what i read sir james damery presents his compliments to mr sherlock holmes and will call upon him at 430 to-morrow sir james begs to say that the matter upon which he desires to consult mr holmes is very delicate and also very important he trusts therefore that mr holmes will make every effort to grant this interview and that he will confirm it over the telephone to the carlton club i need not say that i have confirmed it watson said holmes as i returned the paper do you know anything of this man damery only that his name is a household word in society well i can tell you a little more than that he has rather a reputation for arranging delicate matters which are to be kept out of the papers you may remember his negotiations with sir george lewis over the hammerford will case he is a man of the world with a natural turn for diplomacy i am bound therefore to hope that it is not a false scent and that he has some real need for our assistance our well if you will be so good watson i shall be honoured then you have the hour--four-thirty until then we can put the matter out of our heads i was living in my own rooms in queen anne street at the time but i was round at baker street before the time named sharp to the half-hour colonel sir james damery was announced it is hardly necessary to describe him for many will remember that large bluff honest personality that broad clean-shaven face above all that pleasant mellow voice frankness shone from his grey irish eyes and good humour played round his mobile smiling lips his lucent top-hat his dark frock-coat indeed every detail from the pearl pin in the black satin cravat to the lavender spats over the varnished shoes spoke of the meticulous care in dress for which he was famous the big masterful aristocrat dominated the little room of course i was prepared to find dr watson he remarked with a courteous bow his collaboration may be very necessary for we are dealing on this occasion mr holmes with a man to whom violence is familiar and who will literally stick at nothing i should say that there is no more dangerous man in europe i have had several opponents to whom that flattering term has been applied said holmes with a smile don't you smoke then you will excuse me if i light my pipe if your man is more dangerous than the late professor moriarty or than the living colonel sebastian moran then he is indeed worth meeting may i ask his name have you ever heard of baron gruner you mean the austrian murderer colonel damery threw up his kid-gloved hands with a laugh there is no getting past you mr holmes wonderful so you have already sized him up as a murderer it is my business to follow the details of continental crime who could possibly have read what happened at prague and have any doubts as to the man's guilt it was a purely technical legal point and the suspicious death of a witness that saved him i am as sure that he killed his wife when the so-called 'accident' happened in the splügen pass as if i had seen him do it i knew also that he had come to england and had a presentiment that sooner or later he would find me some work to do well what has baron gruner been up to i presume it is not this old tragedy which has come up again no it is more serious than that to revenge crime is important but to prevent it is more so it is a terrible thing mr holmes to see a dreadful event an atrocious situation preparing itself before your eyes to clearly understand whither it will lead and yet to be utterly unable to avert it can a human being be placed in a more trying position perhaps not then you will sympathize with the client in whose interests i am acting i did not understand that you were merely an intermediary who is the principal mr holmes i must beg you not to press that question it is important that i should be able to assure him that his honoured name has been in no way dragged into the matter his motives are to the last degree honourable and chivalrous but he prefers to remain unknown i need not say that your fees will be assured and that you will be given a perfectly free hand surely the actual name of your client is immaterial i am sorry said holmes i am accustomed to have mystery at one end of my cases but to have it at both ends is too confusing i fear sir james that i must decline to act our visitor was greatly disturbed his large sensitive face was darkened with emotion and disappointment you hardly realize the effect of your own action mr holmes said he you place me in a most serious dilemma for i am perfectly certain that you would be proud to take over the case if i could give you the facts and yet a promise forbids me from revealing them all may i at least lay all that i can before you by all means so long as it is understood that i commit myself to nothing that is understood in the first place you have no doubt heard of general de merville de merville of khyber fame yes i have heard of him he has a daughter violet de merville young rich beautiful accomplished a wonder-woman in every way it is this daughter this lovely innocent girl whom we are endeavouring to save from the clutches of a fiend baron gruner has some hold over her then the strongest of all holds where a woman is concerned--the hold of love the fellow is as you may have heard extraordinarily handsome with a most fascinating manner a gentle voice and that air of romance and mystery which means so much to a woman he is said to have the whole sex at his mercy and to have made ample use of the fact but how came such a man to meet a lady of the standing of miss violet de merville it was on a mediterranean yachting voyage the company though select paid their own passages no doubt the promoters hardly realized the baron's true character until it was too late the villain attached himself to the lady and with such effect that he has completely and absolutely won her heart to say that she loves him hardly expresses it she dotes upon him she is obsessed by him outside of him there is nothing on earth she will not hear one word against him everything has been done to cure her of her madness but in vain to sum up she proposes to marry him next month as she is of age and has a will of iron it is hard to know how to prevent her does she know about the austrian episode the cunning devil has told her every unsavoury public scandal of his past life but always in such a way as to make himself out to be an innocent martyr she absolutely accepts his version and will listen to no other dear me but surely you have inadvertently let out the name of your client it is no doubt general de merville our visitor fidgeted in his chair i could deceive you by saying so mr holmes but it would not be true de merville is a broken man the strong soldier has been utterly demoralized by this incident he has lost the nerve which never failed him on the battlefield and has become a weak doddering old man utterly incapable of contending with a brilliant forceful rascal like this austrian my client however is an old friend one who has known the general intimately for many years and taken a paternal interest in this young girl since she wore short frocks he cannot see this tragedy consummated without some attempt to stop it there is nothing in which scotland yard can act it was his own suggestion that you should be called in but it was as i have said on the express stipulation that he should not be personally involved in the matter i have no doubt mr holmes with your great powers you could easily trace my client back through me but i must ask you as a point of honour to refrain from doing so and not to break in upon his incognito holmes gave a whimsical smile i think i may safely promise that said he i may add that your problem interests me and that i shall be prepared to look into it how shall i keep in touch with you the carlton club will find me but in case of emergency there is a private telephone call 'xx31' holmes noted it down and sat still smiling with the open memorandum-book upon his knee the baron's present address please vernon lodge near kingston it is a large house he has been fortunate in some rather shady speculations and is a rich man which naturally makes him a more dangerous antagonist is he at home at present yes apart from what you have told me can you give me any further information about the man he has expensive tastes he is a horse fancier for a short time he played polo at hurlingham but then this prague affair got noised about and he had to leave he collects books and pictures he is a man with a considerable artistic side to his nature he is i believe a recognized authority upon chinese pottery and has written a book upon the subject a complex mind said holmes all great criminals have that my old friend charlie peace was a violin virtuoso wainwright was no mean artist i could quote many more well sir james you will inform your client that i am turning my mind upon baron gruner i can say no more i have some sources of information of my own and dare say we may find some means of opening matter up when our visitor had left us holmes sat so long in deep thought that it seemed to me that he had forgotten my presence at last however he came briskly back to earth well watson any views he asked i should think you had better see the young lady herself my dear watson if her poor old broken father cannot move her how shall i a stranger prevail and yet there is something in the suggestion if all else fails but i think we must begin from a different angle i rather fancy that shinwell johnson might be a help i have not had occasion to mention shinwell johnson in these memoirs because i have seldom drawn my cases from the latter phases of my friend's career during the first years of the century he became a valuable assistant johnson i grieve to say made his name first as a very dangerous villain and served two terms at parkhurst finally he repented and allied himself to holmes acting as his agent in the huge criminal underworld of london and obtaining information which often proved to be of vital importance had johnson been a nark of the police he would soon have been exposed but as he dealt with cases which never came directly into the courts his activities were never realized by his companions with the glamour of his two convictions upon him he had the _entrée_ of every night-club doss-house and gambling-den in the town and his quick observation and active brain made him an ideal agent for gaining information it was to him that sherlock holmes now proposed to turn it was not possible for me to follow the immediate steps taken by my friend for i had some pressing professional business of my own but i met him by appointment that evening at simpson's where sitting at a small table in the front window and looking down at the rushing stream of life in the strand he told me something of what had passed johnson is on the prowl said he he may pick up some garbage in the darker recesses of the underworld for it is down there amid the black roots of crime that we must hunt for this man's secrets but if the lady will not accept what is already known why should any fresh discovery of yours turn her from her purpose who knows watson woman's heart and mind are insoluble puzzles to the male murder might be condoned or explained and yet some smaller offence might rankle baron gruner remarked to me---- he remarked to you oh to be sure i had not told you of my plans well watson i love to come to close grips with my man i like to meet him eye to eye and read for myself the stuff that he is made of when i had given johnson his instructions i took a cab out to kingston and found the baron in a most affable mood did he recognize you there was no difficulty about that for i simply sent in my card he is an excellent antagonist cool as ice silky voiced and soothing as one of your fashionable consultants and poisonous as a cobra he has breed in him a real aristocrat of crime with a superficial suggestion of afternoon tea and all the cruelty of the grave behind it yes i am glad to have had my attention called to baron adelbert gruner you say he was affable a purring cat who thinks he sees prospective mice some people's affability is more deadly than the violence of coarser souls his greeting was characteristic 'i rather thought i should see you sooner or later mr holmes' said he 'you have been engaged no doubt by general de merville to endeavour to stop my marriage with his daughter violet that is so is it not' i acquiesced 'my dear man' said he 'you will only ruin your own well-deserved reputation it is not a case in which you can possibly succeed you will have barren work to say nothing of incurring some danger let me very strongly advise you to draw off at once' 'it is curious' i answered 'but that was the very advice which i had intended to give you i have a respect for your brains baron and the little which i have seen of your personality has not lessened it let me put it to you as man to man no one wants to rake up your past and make you unduly uncomfortable it is over and you are now in smooth waters but if you persist in this marriage you will raise up a swarm of powerful enemies who will never leave you alone until they have made england too hot to hold you is the game worth it surely you would be wiser if you left the lady alone it would not be pleasant for you if these facts of your past were brought to her notice' the baron has little waxed tips of hair under his nose like the short antennae of an insect these quivered with amusement as he listened and he finally broke into a gentle chuckle 'excuse my amusement mr holmes' said he 'but it is really funny to see you trying to play a hand with no cards in it i don't think anyone could do it better but it is rather pathetic all the same not a colour card there mr holmes nothing but the smallest of the small' 'so you think' 'so i know let me make the thing clear to you for my own hand is so strong that i can afford to show it i have been fortunate enough to win the entire affection of this lady this was given to me in spite of the fact that i told her very clearly of all the unhappy incidents in my past life i also told her that certain wicked and designing persons--i hope you recognize yourself--would come to her and tell her these things and i warned her how to treat them you have heard of post-hypnotic suggestion mr holmes well you will see how it works for a man of personality can use hypnotism without any vulgar passes or tomfoolery so she is ready for you and i have no doubt would give you an appointment for she is quite amenable to her father's will--save only in the one little matter' well watson there seemed to be no more to say so i took my leave with as much cold dignity as i could summon but as i had my hand on the door-handle he stopped me 'by the way mr holmes' said he 'did you know le brun the french agent' 'yes' said i 'do you know what befell him' 'i heard that he was beaten by some apaches in the montmartre district and crippled for life' 'quite true mr holmes by a curious coincidence he had been inquiring into my affairs only a week before don't do it mr holmes it's not a lucky thing to do several have found that out my last word to you is go your own way and let me go mine good-bye' so there you are watson you are up to date now the fellow seems dangerous mighty dangerous i disregard the blusterer but this is the sort of man who says rather less than he means must you interfere does it really matter if he marries the girl considering that he undoubtedly murdered his last wife i should say it mattered very much besides the client well well we need not discuss that when you have finished your coffee you had best come home with me for the blithe shinwell will be there with his report we found him sure enough a huge coarse red-faced scorbutic man with a pair of vivid black eyes which were the only external sign of the very cunning mind within it seems that he had dived down into what was peculiarly his kingdom and beside him on the settee was a brand which he had brought up in the shape of a slim flame-like young woman with a pale intense face youthful and yet so worn with sin and sorrow that one read the terrible years which had left their leprous mark upon her this is miss kitty winter said shinwell johnson waving his fat hand as an introduction what she don't know--well there she'll speak for herself put my hand right on her mr holmes within an hour of your message i'm easy to find said the young woman hell london gets me every time same address for porky shinwell we're old mates porky you and i but by gripes there is another who ought to be down in a lower hell than we if there was any justice in the world that is the man you are after mr holmes holmes smiled i gather we have your good wishes miss winter if i can help to put him where he belongs i'm yours to the rattle said our visitor with fierce energy there was an intensity of hatred in her white set face and her blazing eyes such as woman seldom and man never can attain you needn't go into my past mr holmes that's neither here nor there but what i am adelbert gruner made me if i could pull him down she clutched frantically with her hands into the air oh if i could only pull him into the pit where he has pushed so many you know how the matter stands porky shinwell has been telling me he's after some other poor fool and wants to marry her this time you want to stop it well you surely know enough about this devil to prevent any decent girl in her senses wanting to be in the same parish with him she is not in her senses she is madly in love she has been told all about him she cares nothing told about the murder yes my lord she must have a nerve she puts them all down as slanders couldn't you lay proofs before her silly eyes well can you help us do so ain't i a proof myself if i stood before her and told her how he used me---- would you do this would i would i not well it might be worth trying but he has told her most of his sins and had pardon from her and i understand she will not reopen the question i'll lay he didn't tell her all said miss winter i caught a glimpse of one or two murders besides the one that made such a fuss he would speak of someone in his velvet way and then look at me with a steady eye and say 'he died within a month' it wasn't hot air either but i took little notice--you see i loved him myself at that time whatever he did went with me same as with this poor fool there was just one thing that shook me yes by gripes if it had not been for his poisonous lying tongue that explains and soothes i'd have left him that very night it's a book he has--a brown leather book with a lock and his arms in gold on the outside i think he was a bit drunk that night or he would not have shown it to me what was it then i tell you mr holmes this man collects women and takes a pride in his collection as some men collect moths or butterflies he had it all in that book snapshot photographs names details everything about them it was a beastly book--a book no man even if he had come from the gutter could have put together but it was adelbert gruner's book all the same 'souls i have ruined' he could have put that on the outside if he had been so minded however that's neither here nor there for the book would not serve you and if it would you can't get it where is it how can i tell you where it is now it's more than a year since i left him i know where he kept it then he's a precise tidy cat of a man in many of his ways so maybe it is still in the pigeon-hole of the old bureau in the inner study do you know his house i've been in the study said holmes have you though you haven't been slow on the job if you only started this morning maybe dear adelbert has met his match this time the outer study is the one with the chinese crockery in it--big glass cupboard between the windows then behind his desk is the door that leads to the inner study--a small room where he keeps papers and things is he not afraid of burglars adelbert is no coward his worst enemy couldn't say that of him he can look after himself there's a burglar alarm at night besides what is there for a burglar--unless they got away with all this fancy crockery no good said shinwell johnson with the decided voice of the expert no fence wants stuff of that sort that you can neither melt nor sell quite so said holmes well now miss winter if you would call here to-morrow evening at five i would consider in the meanwhile whether your suggestion of seeing this lady personally may not be arranged i am exceedingly obliged to you for your co-operation i need not say that my clients will consider liberally---- none of that mr holmes cried the young woman i am not out for money let me see this man in the mud and i've got all i worked for--in the mud with my foot on his cursed face that's my price i'm with you to-morrow or any other day so long as you are on his track porky here can tell you always where to find me i did not see holmes again until the following evening when we dined once more at our strand restaurant he shrugged his shoulders when i asked him what luck he had had in his interview then he told the story which i would repeat in this way his hard dry statement needs some little editing to soften it into the terms of real life there was no difficulty at all about the appointment said holmes for the girl glories in showing abject filial obedience in all secondary things in an attempt to atone for her flagrant breach of it in her engagement the general 'phoned that all was ready and the fiery miss w turned up according to schedule so that at half-past five a cab deposited us outside 104 berkeley square where the old soldier resides--one of those awful grey london castles which would make a church seem frivolous a footman showed us into a great yellow-curtained drawing-room and there was the lady awaiting us demure pale self-contained as inflexible and remote as a snow image on a mountain i don't quite know how to make her clear to you watson perhaps you may meet her before we are through and you can use your own gift of words she is beautiful but with the ethereal other-world beauty of some fanatic whose thoughts are set on high i have seen such faces in the pictures of the old masters of the middle ages how a beast-man could have laid his vile paws upon such a being of the beyond i cannot imagine you may have noticed how extremes call to each other the spiritual to the animal the cave-man to the angel you never saw a worse case than this she knew what we had come for of course--that villain had lost no time in poisoning her mind against us miss winter's advent rather amazed her i think but she waved us into our respective chairs like a reverend abbess receiving two rather leprous mendicants if your head is inclined to swell my dear watson take a course of miss violet de merville 'well sir' said she in a voice like the wind from an iceberg 'your name is familiar to me you have called as i understand to malign my fiancé baron gruner it is only by my father's request that i see you at all and i warn you in advance that anything you can say could not possibly have the slightest effect upon my mind' i was sorry for her watson i thought of her for the moment as i would have thought of a daughter of my own i am not often eloquent i use my head not my heart but i really did plead with her with all the warmth of words that i could find in my nature i pictured to her the awful position of the woman who only wakes to a man's character after she is his wife--a woman who has to submit to be caressed by bloody hands and lecherous lips i spared her nothing--the shame the fear the agony the hopelessness of it all all my hot words could not bring one tinge of colour to those ivory cheeks or one gleam of emotion to those abstracted eyes i thought of what the rascal had said about a post-hypnotic influence one could really believe that she was living above the earth in some ecstatic dream yet there was nothing indefinite in her replies 'i have listened to you with patience mr holmes' said she 'the effect upon my mind is exactly as predicted i am aware that adelbert that my fiancé has had a stormy life in which he has incurred bitter hatreds and most unjust aspersions you are only the last of a series who have brought their slanders before me possibly you mean well though i learn that you are a paid agent who would have been equally willing to act for the baron as against him but in any case i wish you to understand once for all that i love him and that he loves me and that the opinion of all the world is no more to me than the twitter of those birds outside the window if his noble nature has ever for an instant fallen it may be that i have been specially sent to raise it to its true and lofty level i am not clear' here she turned her eyes upon my companion 'who this young lady may be' i was about to answer when the girl broke in like a whirlwind if ever you saw flame and ice face to face it was those two women 'i'll tell you who i am' she cried springing out of her chair her mouth all twisted with passion--'i am his last mistress i am one of a hundred that he has tempted and used and ruined and thrown into the refuse heap as he will you also _your_ refuse heap is more likely to be a grave and maybe that's the best i tell you you foolish woman if you marry this man he'll be the death of you it may be a broken heart or it may be a broken neck but he'll have you one way or the other it's not out of love for you i'm speaking i don't care a tinker's curse whether you live or die it's out of hate for him and to spite him and to get back on him for what he did to me but it's all the same and you needn't look at me like that my fine lady for you may be lower than i am before you are through with it' 'i should prefer not to discuss such matters' said miss de merville coldly 'let me say once for all that i am aware of three passages in my fiancé's life in which he became entangled with designing women and that i am assured of his hearty repentance for any evil that he may have done' 'three passages' screamed my companion 'you fool you unutterable fool' 'mr holmes i beg that you will bring this interview to an end' said the icy voice 'i have obeyed my father's wish in seeing you but i am not compelled to listen to the ravings of this person' with an oath miss winter darted forward and if i had not caught her wrist she would have clutched this maddening woman by the hair i dragged her towards the door and was lucky to get her back into the cab without a public scene for she was beside herself with rage in a cold way i felt pretty furious myself watson for there was something indescribably annoying in the calm aloofness and supreme self-complaisance of the woman whom we were trying to save so now once again you know exactly how we stand and it is clear that i must plan some fresh opening move for this gambit won't work i'll keep in touch with you watson for it is more than likely that you will have your part to play though it is just possible that the next move may lie with them rather than with us and it did their blow fell--or his blow rather for never could i believe that the lady was privy to it i think i could show you the very paving-stone upon which i stood when my eyes fell upon the placard and a pang of horror passed through my very soul it was between the grand hotel and charing cross station where a one-legged news-vendor displayed his evening papers the date was just two days after the last conversation there black upon yellow was the terrible news-sheet +-------------+ | murderous | | attack | | upon | | sherlock | | holmes | +-------------+ i think i stood stunned for some moments then i have a confused recollection of snatching at a paper of the remonstrance of the man whom i had not paid and finally of standing in the doorway of a chemist's shop while i turned up the fateful paragraph this was how it ran we learn with regret that mr sherlock holmes the well-known private detective was the victim this morning of a murderous assault which has left him in a precarious position there are no exact details to hand but the event seems to have occurred about twelve o'clock in regent street outside the café royal the attack was made by two men armed with sticks and mr holmes was beaten about the head and body receiving injuries which the doctors describe as most serious he was carried to charing cross hospital and afterwards insisted upon being taken to his rooms in baker street the miscreants who attacked him appear to have been respectably dressed men who escaped from the bystanders by passing through the café royal and out into glasshouse street behind it no doubt they belonged to that criminal fraternity which has so often had occasion to bewail the activity and ingenuity of the injured man i need not say that my eyes had hardly glanced over the paragraph before i had sprung into a hansom and was on my way to baker street i found sir leslie oakshott the famous surgeon in the hall and his brougham waiting at the kerb no immediate danger was his report two lacerated scalp wounds and some considerable bruises several stitches have been necessary morphine has been injected and quiet is essential but an interview of a few minutes would not be absolutely forbidden with this permission i stole into the darkened room the sufferer was wide awake and i heard my name in a hoarse whisper the blind was three-quarters down but one ray of sunlight slanted through and struck the bandaged head of the injured man a crimson patch had soaked through the white linen compress i sat beside him and bent my head all right watson don't look so scared he muttered in a very weak voice it's not as bad as it seems thank god for that i'm a bit of a single-stick expert as you know i took most of them on my guard it was the second man that was too much for me what can i do holmes of course it was that damned fellow who set them on i'll go and thrash the hide off him if you give the word good old watson no we can do nothing there unless the police lay their hands on the men but their get-away had been well prepared we may be sure of that wait a little i have my plans the first thing is to exaggerate my injuries they'll come to you for news put it on thick watson lucky if i live the week out--concussion--delirium--what you like you can't overdo it but sir leslie oakshott oh he's all right he shall see the worst side of me i'll look after that anything else yes tell shinwell johnson to get that girl out of the way those beauties will be after her now they know of course that she was with me in the case if they dared to do me in it is not likely they will neglect her that is urgent do it to-night i'll go now anything more put my pipe on the table--and the tobacco-slipper right come in each morning and we will plan our campaign i arranged with johnson that evening to take miss winter to a quiet suburb and see that she lay low until the danger was past for six days the public were under the impression that holmes was at the door of death the bulletins were very grave and there were sinister paragraphs in the papers my continual visits assured me that it was not so bad as that his wiry constitution and his determined will were working wonders he was recovering fast and i had suspicions at times that he was really finding himself faster than he pretended even to me there was a curious secretive streak in the man which led to many dramatic effects but left even his closest friend guessing as to what his exact plans might be he pushed to an extreme the axiom that the only safe plotter was he who plotted alone i was nearer him than anyone else and yet i was always conscious of the gap between on the seventh day the stitches were taken out in spite of which there was a report of erysipelas in the evening papers the same evening papers had an announcement which i was bound sick or well to carry to my friend it was simply that among the passengers on the cunard boat _ruritania_ starting from liverpool on friday was the baron adelbert gruner who had some important financial business to settle in the states before his impending wedding to miss violet de merville only daughter of etc etc holmes listened to the news with a cold concentrated look upon his pale face which told me that it hit him hard friday he cried only three clear days i believe the rascal wants to put himself out of danger's way but he won't watson by the lord harry he won't now watson i want you to do something for me i am here to be used holmes well then spend the next twenty-four hours in an intensive study of chinese pottery he gave no explanations and i asked for none by long experience i had learned the wisdom of obedience but when i had left his room i walked down baker street revolving in my head how on earth i was to carry out so strange an order finally i drove to the london library in st james's square put the matter to my friend lomax the sub-librarian and departed to my rooms with a goodly volume under my arm it is said that the barrister who crams up a case with such care that he can examine an expert witness upon the monday has forgotten all his forced knowledge before the saturday certainly i should not like now to pose as an authority upon ceramics and yet all that evening and all that night with a short interval for rest and all next morning i was sucking in knowledge and committing names to memory there i learned of the hall-marks of the great artist-decorators of the mystery of cyclical dates the marks of the hung-wu and the beauties of the yung-lo the writings of tang-ying and the glories of the primitive period of the sung and the yuan i was charged with all this information when i called upon holmes next evening he was out of bed now though you would not have guessed it from the published reports and he sat with his much-bandaged head resting upon his hand in the depth of his favourite arm-chair why holmes i said if one believed the papers you are dying that said he is the very impression which i intended to convey and now watson have you learned your lessons at least i have tried to good you could keep up an intelligent conversation on the subject i believe i could then hand me that little box from the mantel-piece he opened the lid and took out a small object most carefully wrapped in some fine eastern silk this he unfolded and disclosed a delicate little saucer of the most beautiful deep-blue colour it needs careful handling watson this is the real egg-shell pottery of the ming dynasty no finer piece ever passed through christie's a complete set of this would be worth a king's ransom--in fact it is doubtful if there is a complete set outside the imperial palace of peking the sight of this would drive a real connoisseur wild what am i to do with it holmes handed me a card upon which was printed dr hill barton 369 half moon street that is your name for the evening watson you will call upon baron gruner i know something of his habits and at half-past eight he would probably be disengaged a note will tell him in advance that you are about to call and you will say that you are bringing him a specimen of an absolutely unique set of ming china you may as well be a medical man since that is a part which you can play without duplicity you are a collector this set has come your way you have heard of the baron's interest in the subject and you are not averse to selling at a price what price well asked watson you would certainly fall down badly if you did not know the value of your own wares this saucer was got for me by sir james and comes i understand from the collection of his client you will not exaggerate if you say that it could hardly be matched in the world i could perhaps suggest that the set should be valued by an expert excellent watson you scintillate to-day suggest christie or sotheby your delicacy prevents your putting a price for yourself but if he won't see me oh yes he will see you he has the collection mania in its most acute form--and especially on this subject on which he is an acknowledged authority sit down watson and i will dictate the letter no answer needed you will merely say that you are coming and why it was an admirable document short courteous and stimulating to the curiosity of the connoisseur a district messenger was duly dispatched with it on the same evening with the precious saucer in my hand and the card of dr hill barton in my pocket i set off on my own adventure the beautiful house and grounds indicated that baron gruner was as sir james had said a man of considerable wealth a long winding drive with banks of rare shrubs on either side opened out into a great gravelled square adorned with statues the place had been built by a south african gold king in the days of the great boom and the long low house with the turrets at the corners though an architectural nightmare was imposing in its size and solidity a butler who would have adorned a bench of bishops showed me in and handed me over to a plush-clad footman who ushered me into the baron's presence he was standing at the open front of a great case which stood between the windows and which contained part of his chinese collection he turned as i entered with a small brown vase in his hand pray sit down doctor said he i was looking over my own treasures and wondering whether i could really afford to add to them this little tang specimen which dates from the seventh century would probably interest you i am sure you never saw finer workmanship or a richer glaze have you the ming saucer with you of which you spoke i carefully unpacked it and handed it to him he seated himself at his desk pulled over the lamp for it was growing dark and set himself to examine it as he did so the yellow light beat upon his own features and i was able to study them at my ease he was certainly a remarkably handsome man his european reputation for beauty was fully deserved in figure he was not more than of middle size but was built upon graceful and active lines his face was swarthy almost oriental with large dark languorous eyes which might easily hold an irresistible fascination for women his hair and moustache were raven black the latter short pointed and carefully waxed his features were regular and pleasing save only his straight thin-lipped mouth if ever i saw a murderer's mouth it was there--a cruel hard gash in the face compressed inexorable and terrible he was ill-advised to train his moustache away from it for it was nature's danger-signal set as a warning to his victims his voice was engaging and his manners perfect in age i should have put him at little over thirty though his record afterwards showed that he was forty-two very fine--very fine indeed he said at last and you say you have a set of six to correspond what puzzles me is that i should not have heard of such magnificent specimens i only know of one in england to match this and it is certainly not likely to be in the market would it be indiscreet if i were to ask you dr hill barton how you obtained this does it really matter i asked with as careless an air as i could muster you can see that the piece is genuine and as to the value i am content to take an expert's valuation very mysterious said he with a quick suspicious flash of his dark eyes in dealing with objects of such value one naturally wishes to know all about the transaction that the piece is genuine is certain i have no doubts at all about that but suppose--i am bound to take every possibility into account--that it should prove afterwards that you had no right to sell i would guarantee you against any claim of the sort that of course would open up the question as to what your guarantee was worth my bankers would answer that quite so and yet the whole transaction strikes me as rather unusual you can do business or not said i with indifference i have given you the first offer as i understood that you were a connoisseur but i shall have no difficulty in other quarters who told you i was a connoisseur i was aware that you had written a book upon the subject have you read the book no dear me this becomes more and more difficult for me to understand you are a connoisseur and collector with a very valuable piece in your collection and yet you have never troubled to consult the one book which would have told you of the real meaning and value of what you held how do you explain that i am a very busy man i am a doctor in practice that is no answer if a man has a hobby he follows it up whatever his other pursuits may be you said in your note that you were a connoisseur so i am might i ask you a few questions to test you i am obliged to tell you doctor--if you are indeed a doctor--that the incident becomes more and more suspicious i would ask you what do you know of the emperor shomu and how do you associate him with the shoso-in near nara dear me does that puzzle you tell me a little about the northern wei dynasty and its place in the history of ceramics i sprang from my chair in simulated anger this is intolerable sir said i i came here to do you a favour and not to be examined as if i were a schoolboy my knowledge on these subjects may be second only to your own but i certainly shall not answer questions which have been put in so offensive a way he looked at me steadily the languor had gone from his eyes they suddenly glared there was a gleam of teeth from between those cruel lips what is the game you are here as a spy you are an emissary of holmes this is a trick that you are playing upon me the fellow is dying i hear so he sends his tools to keep watch upon me you've made your way in here without leave and by god you may find it harder to get out than to get in he had sprung to his feet and i stepped back bracing myself for an attack for the man was beside himself with rage he may have suspected me from the first certainly this cross-examination had shown him the truth but it was clear that i could not hope to deceive him he dived his hand into a side-drawer and rummaged furiously then something struck upon his ear for he stood listening intently ah he cried ah and dashed into the room behind him two steps took me to the open door and my mind will ever carry a clear picture of the scene within the window leading out to the garden was wide open beside it looking like some terrible ghost his head girt with bloody bandages his face drawn and white stood sherlock holmes the next instant he was through the gap and i heard the crash of his body among the laurel bushes outside with a howl of rage the master of the house rushed after him to the open window and then it was done in an instant and yet i clearly saw it an arm--a woman's arm--shot out from among the leaves at the same instant the baron uttered a horrible cry--a yell which will always ring in my memory he clapped his two hands to his face and rushed round the room beating his head horribly against the walls then he fell upon the carpet rolling and writhing while scream after scream resounded through the house water for god's sake water was his cry i seized a carafe from a side-table and rushed to his aid at the same moment the butler and several footmen ran in from the hall i remember that one of them fainted as i knelt by the injured man and turned that awful face to the light of the lamp the vitriol was eating into it everywhere and dripping from the ears and the chin one eye was already white and glazed the other was red and inflamed the features which i had admired a few minutes before were now like some beautiful painting over which the artist has passed a wet and foul sponge they were blurred discoloured inhuman terrible in a few words i explained exactly what had occurred so far as the vitriol attack was concerned some had climbed through the window and others had rushed out on to the lawn but it was dark and it had begun to rain between his screams the victim raged and raved against the avenger it was that hell-cat kitty winter he cried oh the she-devil she shall pay for it she shall pay oh god in heaven this pain is more than i can bear i bathed his face in oil put cotton wadding on the raw surfaces and administered a hypodermic of morphia all suspicion of me had passed from his mind in the presence of this shock and he clung to my hands as if i might have the power even yet to clear those dead-fish eyes which gazed up at me i could have wept over the ruin had i not remembered very clearly the vile life which had led up to so hideous a change it was loathsome to feel the pawing of his burning hands and i was relieved when his family surgeon closely followed by a specialist came to relieve me of my charge an inspector of police had also arrived and to him i handed my real card it would have been useless as well as foolish to do otherwise for i was nearly as well known by sight at the yard as holmes himself then i left that house of gloom and terror within an hour i was at baker street holmes was seated in his familiar chair looking very pale and exhausted apart from his injuries even his iron nerves had been shocked by the events of the evening and he listened with horror to my account of the baron's transformation the wages of sin watson--the wages of sin said he sooner or later it will always come god knows there was sin enough he added taking up a brown volume from the table here is the book the woman talked of if this will not break off the marriage nothing ever could but it will watson it must no self-respecting woman could stand it it is his love diary or his lust diary call it what you will the moment the woman told us of it i realized what a tremendous weapon was there if we could but lay our hands on it i said nothing at the time to indicate my thoughts for this woman might have given it away but i brooded over it then this assault upon me gave me the chance of letting the baron think that no precautions need be taken against me that was all to the good i would have waited a little longer but his visit to america forced my hand he would never have left so compromising a document behind him therefore we had to act at once burglary at night is impossible he takes precautions but there was a chance in the evening if i could only be sure that his attention was engaged that was where you and your blue saucer came in but i had to be sure of the position of the book and i knew i had only a few minutes in which to act for my time was limited by your knowledge of chinese pottery therefore i gathered the girl up at the last moment how could i guess what the little packet was that she carried so carefully under her cloak i thought she had come altogether on my business but it seems she had some of her own he guessed i came from you i feared he would but you held him in play just long enough for me to get the book though not long enough for an unobserved escape ah sir james i am very glad you have come our courtly friend had appeared in answer to a previous summons he listened with the deepest attention to holmes's account of what had occurred you have done wonders--wonders he cried when he had heard the narrative but if these injuries are as terrible as dr watson describes then surely our purpose of thwarting the marriage is sufficiently gained without the use of this horrible book holmes shook his head women of the de merville type do not act like that she would love him the more as a disfigured martyr no no it is his moral side not his physical which we have to destroy that book will bring her back to earth--and i know nothing else that could it is in his own writing she cannot get past it sir james carried away both it and the precious saucer as i was myself overdue i went down with him into the street a brougham was waiting for him he sprang in gave a hurried order to the cockaded coachman and drove swiftly away he flung his overcoat half out of the window to cover the armorial bearings upon the panel but i had seen them in the glare of our fanlight none the less i gasped with surprise then i turned back and ascended the stair to holmes's room i have found out who our client is i cried bursting with my great news why holmes it is---- it is a loyal friend and a chivalrous gentleman said holmes holding up a restraining hand let that now and for ever be enough for us i do not know how the incriminating book was used sir james may have managed it or it is more probable that so delicate a task was entrusted to the young lady's father the effect at any rate was all that could be desired three days later appeared a paragraph in _the morning post_ to say that the marriage between baron adelbert gruner and miss violet de merville would not take place the same paper had the first police-court hearing of the proceedings against miss kitty winter on the grave charge of vitriol-throwing such extenuating circumstances came out in the trial that the sentence as will be remembered was the lowest that was possible for such an offence sherlock holmes was threatened with a prosecution for burglary but when an object is good and a client is sufficiently illustrious even the rigid british law becomes human and elastic my friend has not yet stood in the dock ii the adventure of the blanched soldier the ideas of my friend watson though limited are exceedingly pertinacious for a long time he has worried me to write an experience of my own perhaps i have rather invited this persecution since i have often had occasion to point out to him how superficial are his own accounts and to accuse him of pandering to popular taste instead of confining himself rigidly to facts and figures try it yourself holmes he has retorted and i am compelled to admit that having taken my pen in my hand i do begin to realize that the matter must be presented in such a way as may interest the reader the following case can hardly fail to do so as it is among the strangest happenings in my collection though it chanced that watson had no note of it in his collection speaking of my old friend and biographer i would take this opportunity to remark that if i burden myself with a companion in my various little inquiries it is not done out of sentiment or caprice but it is that watson has some remarkable characteristics of his own to which in his modesty he has given small attention amid his exaggerated estimates of my own performances a confederate who foresees your conclusions and course of action is always dangerous but one to whom each development comes as a perpetual surprise and to whom the future is always a closed book is indeed an ideal helpmate i find from my notebook that it was in january 1903 just after the conclusion of the boer war that i had my visit from mr james m dodd a big fresh sunburned upstanding briton the good watson had at that time deserted me for a wife the only selfish action which i can recall in our association i was alone it is my habit to sit with my back to the window and to place my visitors in the opposite chair where the light falls full upon them mr james m dodd seemed somewhat at a loss how to begin the interview i did not attempt to help him for his silence gave me more time for observation i have found it wise to impress clients with a sense of power and so i gave him some of my conclusions from south africa sir i perceive yes sir he answered with some surprise imperial yeomanry i fancy exactly middlesex corps no doubt that is so mr holmes you are a wizard i smiled at his bewildered expression when a gentleman of virile appearance enters my room with such tan upon his face as an english sun could never give and with his handkerchief in his sleeve instead of in his pocket it is not difficult to place him you wear a short beard which shows that you were not a regular you have the cut of a riding-man as to middlesex your card has already shown me that you are a stockbroker from throgmorton street what other regiment would you join you see everything i see no more than you but i have trained myself to notice what i see however mr dodd it was not to discuss the science of observation that you called upon me this morning what has been happening at tuxbury old park mr holmes---- my dear sir there is no mystery your letter came with that heading and as you fixed this appointment in very pressing terms it was clear that something sudden and important had occurred yes indeed but the letter was written in the afternoon and a good deal has happened since then if colonel emsworth had not kicked me out---- kicked you out well that was what it amounted to he is a hard nail is colonel emsworth the greatest martinet in the army in his day and it was a day of rough language too i couldn't have stuck the colonel if it had not been for godfrey's sake i lit my pipe and leaned back in my chair perhaps you will explain what you are talking about my client grinned mischievously i had got into the way of supposing that you knew everything without being told said he but i will give you the facts and i hope to god that you will be able to tell me what they mean i've been awake all night puzzling my brain and the more i think the more incredible does it become when i joined up in january 1901--just two years ago--young godfrey emsworth had joined the same squadron he was colonel emsworth's only son--emsworth the crimean vc--and he had the fighting blood in him so it is no wonder he volunteered there was not a finer lad in the regiment we formed a friendship--the sort of friendship which can only be made when one lives the same life and shares the same joys and sorrows he was my mate--and that means a good deal in the army we took the rough and the smooth together for a year of hard fighting then he was hit with a bullet from an elephant gun in the action near diamond hill outside pretoria i got one letter from the hospital at cape town and one from southampton since then not a word--not one word mr holmes for six months and more and he my closest pal well when the war was over and we all got back i wrote to his father and asked where godfrey was no answer i waited a bit and then i wrote again this time i had a reply short and gruff godfrey had gone on a voyage round the world and it was not likely that he would be back for a year that was all i wasn't satisfied mr holmes the whole thing seemed to me so damned unnatural he was a good lad and he would not drop a pal like that it was not like him then again i happened to know that he was heir to a lot of money and also that his father and he did not always hit it off too well the old man was sometimes a bully and young godfrey had too much spirit to stand it no i wasn't satisfied and i determined that i would get to the root of the matter it happened however that my own affairs needed a lot of straightening out after two years' absence and so it is only this week that i have been able to take up godfrey's case again but since i have taken it up i mean to drop everything in order to see it through mr james m dodd appeared to be the sort of person whom it would be better to have as a friend than as an enemy his blue eyes were stern and his square jaw had set hard as he spoke well what have you done i asked my first move was to get down to his home tuxbury old park near bedford and to see for myself how the ground lay i wrote to the mother therefore--i had had quite enough of the curmudgeon of a father--and i made a clean frontal attack godfrey was my chum i had a great deal of interest which i might tell her of our common experiences i should be in the neighbourhood would there be any objection et cetera in reply i had quite an amiable answer from her and an offer to put me up for the night that was what took me down on monday tuxbury old hall is inaccessible--five miles from anywhere there was no trap at the station so i had to walk carrying my suit-case and it was nearly dark before i arrived it is a great wandering house standing in a considerable park i should judge it was of all sorts of ages and styles starting on a half-timbered elizabethan foundation and ending in a victorian portico inside it was all panelling and tapestry and half-effaced old pictures a house of shadows and mystery there was a butler old ralph who seemed about the same age as the house and there was his wife who might have been older she had been godfrey's nurse and i had heard him speak of her as second only to his mother in his affections so i was drawn to her in spite of her queer appearance the mother i liked also--a gentle little white mouse of a woman it was only the colonel himself whom i barred we had a bit of a barney right away and i should have walked back to the station if i had not felt that it might be playing his game for me to do so i was shown straight into his study and there i found him a huge bow-backed man with a smoky skin and a straggling grey beard seated behind his littered desk a red-veined nose jutted out like a vulture's beak and two fierce grey eyes glared at me from under tufted brows i could understand now why godfrey seldom spoke of his father 'well sir' said he in a rasping voice 'i should be interested to know the real reasons for this visit' i answered that i had explained them in my letter to his wife 'yes yes you said that you had known godfrey in africa we have of course only your word for that' 'i have his letters to me in my pocket' 'kindly let me see them' he glanced at the two which i handed him and then he tossed them back 'well what then' he asked 'i was fond of your son godfrey sir many ties and memories united us is it not natural that i should wonder at his sudden silence and should wish to know what has become of him' 'i have some recollection sir that i had already corresponded with you and had told you what had become of him he has gone upon a voyage round the world his health was in a poor way after his african experiences and both his mother and i were of opinion that complete rest and change were needed kindly pass that explanation on to any other friends who may be interested in the matter' 'certainly' i answered 'but perhaps you would have the goodness to let me have the name of the steamer and of the line by which he sailed together with the date i have no doubt that i should be able to get a letter through to him' my request seemed both to puzzle and to irritate my host his great eyebrows came down over his eyes and he tapped his fingers impatiently on the table he looked up at last with the expression of one who has seen his adversary make a dangerous move at chess and has decided how to meet it 'many people mr dodd' said he 'would take offence at your infernal pertinacity and would think that this insistence had reached the point of damned impertinence' 'you must put it down sir to my real love for your son' 'exactly i have already made every allowance upon that score i must ask you however to drop these inquiries every family has its own inner knowledge and its own motives which cannot always be made clear to outsiders however well-intentioned my wife is anxious to hear something of godfrey's past which you are in a position to tell her but i would ask you to let the present and the future alone such inquiries serve no useful purpose sir and place us in a delicate and difficult position' so i came to a dead end mr holmes there was no getting past it i could only pretend to accept the situation and register a vow inwardly that i would never rest until my friend's fate had been cleared up it was a dull evening we dined quietly the three of us in a gloomy faded old room the lady questioned me eagerly about her son but the old man seemed morose and depressed i was so bored by the whole proceeding that i made an excuse as soon as i decently could and retired to my bedroom it was a large bare room on the ground floor as gloomy as the rest of the house but after a year of sleeping upon the veldt mr holmes one is not too particular about one's quarters i opened the curtains and looked out into the garden remarking that it was a fine night with a bright half-moon then i sat down by the roaring fire with the lamp on a table beside me and endeavoured to distract my mind with a novel i was interrupted however by ralph the old butler who came in with a fresh supply of coals 'i thought you might run short in the night-time sir it is bitter weather and these rooms are cold' he hesitated before leaving the room and when i looked round he was standing facing me with a wistful look upon his wrinkled face 'beg your pardon sir but i could not help hearing what you said of young master godfrey at dinner you know sir that my wife nursed him and so i may say i am his foster-father it's natural we should take an interest and you say he carried himself well sir' 'there was no braver man in the regiment he pulled me out once from under the rifles of the boers or maybe i should not be here' the old butler rubbed his skinny hands 'yes sir yes that is master godfrey all over he was always courageous there's not a tree in the park sir that he has not climbed nothing would stop him he was a fine boy--and oh sir he was a fine man' i sprang to my feet 'look here' i cried 'you say he was you speak as if he were dead what is all this mystery what has become of godfrey emsworth' i gripped the old man by the shoulder but he shrank away 'i don't know what you mean sir ask the master about master godfrey he knows it is not for me to interfere' he was leaving the room but i held his arm 'listen' i said 'you are going to answer one question before you leave if i have to hold you all night is godfrey dead' he could not face my eyes he was like a man hypnotized the answer was dragged from his lips it was a terrible and unexpected one 'i wish to god he was' he cried and tearing himself free he dashed from the room you will think mr holmes that i returned to my chair in no very happy state of mind the old man's words seemed to me to bear only one interpretation clearly my poor friend had become involved in some criminal or at the least disreputable transaction which touched the family honour that stern old man had sent his son away and hidden him from the world lest some scandal should come to light godfrey was a reckless fellow he was easily influenced by those around him no doubt he had fallen into bad hands and been misled to his ruin it was a piteous business if it was indeed so but even now it was my duty to hunt him out and see if i could aid him i was anxiously pondering the matter when i looked up and there was godfrey emsworth standing before me my client had paused as one in deep emotion pray continue i said your problem presents some very unusual features he was outside the window mr holmes with his face pressed against the glass i have told you that i looked out at the night when i did so i left the curtains partly open his figure was framed in this gap the window came down to the ground and i could see the whole length of it but it was his face which held my gaze he was deadly pale--never have i seen a man so white i reckon ghosts may look like that but his eyes met mine and they were the eyes of a living man he sprang back when he saw that i was looking at him and he vanished into the darkness there was something shocking about the man mr holmes it wasn't merely that ghastly face glimmering as white as cheese in the darkness it was more subtle than that--something slinking something furtive something guilty--something very unlike the frank manly lad that i had known it left a feeling of horror in my mind but when a man has been soldiering for a year or two with brother boer as a playmate he keeps his nerve and acts quickly godfrey had hardly vanished before i was at the window there was an awkward catch and i was some little time before i could throw it up then i nipped through and ran down the garden path in the direction that i thought he might have taken it was a long path and the light was not very good but it seemed to me something was moving ahead of me i ran on and called his name but it was no use when i got to the end of the path there were several others branching in different directions to various outhouses i stood hesitating and as i did so i heard distinctly the sound of a closing door it was not behind me in the house but ahead of me somewhere in the darkness that was enough mr holmes to assure me that what i had seen was not a vision godfrey had run away from me and he had shut a door behind him of that i was certain there was nothing more i could do and i spent an uneasy night turning the matter over in my mind and trying to find some theory which would cover the facts next day i found the colonel rather more conciliatory and as his wife remarked that there were some places of interest in the neighbourhood it gave me an opening to ask whether my presence for one more night would incommode them a somewhat grudging acquiescence from the old man gave me a clear day in which to make my observations i was already perfectly convinced that godfrey was in hiding somewhere near but where and why remained to be solved the house was so large and so rambling that a regiment might be hid away in it and no one the wiser if the secret lay there it was difficult for me to penetrate it but the door which i had heard close was certainly not in the house i must explore the garden and see what i could find there was no difficulty in the way for the old people were busy in their own fashion and left me to my own devices there were several small outhouses but at the end of the garden there was a detached building of some size--large enough for a gardener's or a gamekeeper's residence could this be the place whence the sound of that shutting door had come i approached it in a careless fashion as though i were strolling aimlessly round the grounds as i did so a small brisk bearded man in a black coat and bowler hat--not at all the gardener type--came out of the door to my surprise he locked it after him and put the key in his pocket then he looked at me with some surprise on his face 'are you a visitor here' he asked i explained that i was and that i was a friend of godfrey's 'what a pity that he should be away on his travels for he would have so liked to see me' i continued 'quite so exactly' said he with a rather guilty air 'no doubt you will renew your visit at some more propitious time' he passed on but when i turned i observed that he was standing watching me half-concealed by the laurels at the far end of the garden i had a good look at the little house as i passed it but the windows were heavily curtained and so far as one could see it was empty i might spoil my own game and even be ordered off the premises if i were too audacious for i was still conscious that i was being watched therefore i strolled back to the house and waited for night before i went on with my inquiry when all was dark and quiet i slipped out of my window and made my way as silently as possible to the mysterious lodge i have said that it was heavily curtained but now i found that the windows were shuttered as well some light however was breaking through one of them so i concentrated my attention upon this i was in luck for the curtain had not been quite closed and there was a crack in the shutter so that i could see the inside of the room it was a cheery place enough a bright lamp and a blazing fire opposite to me was seated the little man whom i had seen in the morning he was smoking a pipe and reading a paper what paper i asked my client seemed annoyed at the interruption of his narrative can it matter he asked it is most essential i really took no notice possibly you observed whether it was a broad-leafed paper or of that smaller type which one associates with weeklies now that you mention it it was not large it might have been _the spectator_ however i had little thought to spare upon such details for a second man was seated with his back to the window and i could swear that this second man was godfrey i could not see his face but i knew the familiar slope of his shoulders he was leaning upon his elbow in an attitude of great melancholy his body turned towards the fire i was hesitating as to what i should do when there was a sharp tap on my shoulder and there was colonel emsworth beside me 'this way sir' said he in a low voice he walked in silence to the house and i followed him into my own bedroom he had picked up a timetable in the hall 'there is a train to london at eight-thirty' said he 'the trap will be at the door at eight' he was white with rage and indeed i felt myself in so difficult a position that i could only stammer out a few incoherent apologies in which i tried to excuse myself by urging my anxiety for my friend 'the matter will not bear discussion' said he abruptly 'you have made a most damnable intrusion into the privacy of our family you were here as a guest and you have become a spy i have nothing more to say sir save that i have no wish ever to see you again' at this i lost my temper mr holmes and i spoke with some warmth 'i have seen your son and i am convinced that for some reason of your own you are concealing him from the world i have no idea what your motives are in cutting him off in this fashion but i am sure that he is no longer a free agent i warn you colonel emsworth that until i am assured as to the safety and well-being of my friend i shall never desist in my efforts to get to the bottom of the mystery and i shall certainly not allow myself to be intimidated by anything which you may say or do' the old fellow looked diabolical and i really thought he was about to attack me i have said that he was a gaunt fierce old giant and though i am no weakling i might have been hard put to it to hold my own against him however after a long glare of rage he turned upon his heel and walked out of the room for my part i took the appointed train in the morning with the full intention of coming straight to you and asking for your advice and assistance at the appointment for which i had already written such was the problem which my visitor laid before me it presented as the astute reader will have already perceived few difficulties in its solution for a very limited choice of alternatives must get to the root of the matter still elementary as it was there were points of interest and novelty about it which may excuse my placing it upon record i now proceeded using my familiar method of logical analysis to narrow down the possible solutions the servants i asked how many were in the house to the best of my belief there were only the old butler and his wife they seemed to live in the simplest fashion there was no servant then in the detached house none unless the little man with the beard acted as such he seemed however to be quite a superior person that seems very suggestive had you any indication that food was conveyed from the one house to the other now that you mention it i did see old ralph carrying a basket down the garden walk and going in the direction of this house the idea of food did not occur to me at the moment did you make any local inquiries yes i did i spoke to the station-master and also to the innkeeper in the village i simply asked if they knew anything of my old comrade godfrey emsworth both of them assured me that he had gone for a voyage round the world he had come home and then had almost at once started off again the story was evidently universally accepted you said nothing of your suspicions nothing that was very wise the matter should certainly be inquired into i will go back with you to tuxbury old park to-day it happened that at the moment i was clearing up the case which my friend watson has described as that of the abbey school in which the duke of greyminster was so deeply involved i had also a commission from the sultan of turkey which called for immediate action as political consequences of the gravest kind might arise from its neglect therefore it was not until the beginning of the next week as my diary records that i was able to start forth on my mission to bedfordshire in company with mr james m dodd as we drove to euston we picked up a grave and taciturn gentleman of iron-grey aspect with whom i had made the necessary arrangements this is an old friend said i to dodd it is possible that his presence may be entirely unnecessary and on the other hand it may be essential it is not necessary at the present stage to go further into the matter the narratives of watson have accustomed the reader no doubt to the fact that i do not waste words or disclose my thoughts while a case is actually under consideration dodd seemed surprised but nothing more was said and the three of us continued our journey together in the train i asked dodd one more question which i wished our companion to hear you say that you saw your friend's face quite clearly at the window so clearly that you are sure of his identity i have no doubt about it whatever his nose was pressed against the glass the lamplight shone full upon him it could not have been someone resembling him no no it was he but you say he was changed only in colour his face was--how shall i describe it--it was of a fish-belly whiteness it was bleached was it equally pale all over i think not it was his brow which i saw so clearly as it was pressed against the window did you call to him i was too startled and horrified for the moment then i pursued him as i have told you but without result my case was practically complete and there was only one small incident needed to round it off when after a considerable drive we arrived at the strange old rambling house which my client had described it was ralph the elderly butler who opened the door i had requisitioned the carriage for the day and had asked my elderly friend to remain within it unless we should summon him ralph a little wrinkled old fellow was in the conventional costume of black coat and pepper-and-salt trousers with only one curious variant he wore brown leather gloves which at sight of us he instantly shuffled off laying them down on the hall-table as we passed in i have as my friend watson may have remarked an abnormally acute set of senses and a faint but incisive scent was apparent it seemed to centre on the hall-table i turned placed my hat there knocked it off stooped to pick it up and contrived to bring my nose within a foot of the gloves yes it was undoubtedly from them that the curious tarry odour was oozing i passed on into the study with my case complete alas that i should have to show my hand so when i tell my own story it was by concealing such links in the chain that watson was enabled to produce his meretricious finales colonel emsworth was not in his room but he came quickly enough on receipt of ralph's message we heard his quick heavy step in the passage the door was flung open and he rushed in with bristling beard and twisted features as terrible an old man as ever i have seen he held our cards in his hand and he tore them up and stamped on the fragments have i not told you you infernal busybody that you are warned off the premises never dare to show your damned face here again if you enter again without my leave i shall be within my rights if i use violence i'll shoot you sir by god i will as to you sir turning upon me i extend the same warning to you i am familiar with your ignoble profession but you must take your reputed talents to some other field there is no opening for them here i cannot leave here said my client firmly until i hear from godfrey's own lips that he is under no restraint our involuntary host rang the bell ralph he said telephone down to the county police and ask the inspector to send up two constables tell him there are burglars in the house one moment said i you must be aware mr dodd that colonel emsworth is within his rights and that we have no legal status within his house on the other hand he should recognize that your action is prompted entirely by solicitude for his son i venture to hope that if i were allowed to have five minutes' conversation with colonel emsworth i could certainly alter his view of the matter i am not so easily altered said the old soldier ralph do what i have told you what the devil are you waiting for ring up the police nothing of the sort i said putting my back to the door any police interference would bring about the very catastrophe which you dread i took out my notebook and scribbled one word upon a loose sheet that said i as i handed it to colonel emsworth is what has brought us here he stared at the writing with a face from which every expression save amazement had vanished how do you know he gasped sitting down heavily in his chair it is my business to know things that is my trade he sat in deep thought his gaunt hand tugging at his straggling beard then he made a gesture of resignation well if you wish to see godfrey you shall it is no doing of mine but you have forced my hand ralph tell mr godfrey and mr kent that in five minutes we shall be with them at the end of that time we passed down the garden path and found ourselves in front of the mystery house at the end a small bearded man stood at the door with a look of considerable astonishment upon his face this is very sudden colonel emsworth said he this will disarrange all our plans i can't help it mr kent our hands have been forced can mr godfrey see us yes he is waiting inside he turned and led us into a large plainly furnished front room a man was standing with his back to the fire and at the sight of him my client sprang forward with outstretched hand why godfrey old man this is fine but the other waved him back don't touch me jimmie keep your distance yes you may well stare i don't quite look the smart lance-corporal emsworth of b squadron do i his appearance was certainly extraordinary one could see that he had indeed been a handsome man with clear-cut features sunburned by an african sun but mottled in patches over this darker surface were curious whitish patches which had bleached his skin that's why i don't court visitors said he i don't mind you jimmie but i could have done without your friend i suppose there is some good reason for it but you have me at a disadvantage i wanted to be sure that all was well with you godfrey i saw you that night when you looked into my window and i could not let the matter rest till i had cleared things up old ralph told me you were there and i couldn't help taking a peep at you i hoped you would not have seen me and i had to run to my burrow when i heard the window go up but what in heaven's name is the matter well it's not a long story to tell said he lighting a cigarette you remember that morning fight at buffelsspruit outside pretoria on the eastern railway line you heard i was hit yes i heard that but i never got particulars three of us got separated from the others it was very broken country you may remember there was simpson--the fellow we called baldy simpson--and anderson and i we were clearing brother boer but he lay low and got the three of us the other two were killed i got an elephant bullet through my shoulder i stuck on to my horse however and he galloped several miles before i fainted and rolled off the saddle when i came to myself it was nightfall and i raised myself up feeling very weak and ill to my surprise there was a house close beside me a fairly large house with a broad stoep and many windows it was deadly cold you remember the kind of numb cold which used to come at evening a deadly sickening sort of cold very different from a crisp healthy frost well i was chilled to the bone and my only hope seemed to lie in reaching that house i staggered to my feet and dragged myself along hardly conscious of what i did i have a dim memory of slowly ascending the steps entering a wide-opened door passing into a large room which contained several beds and throwing myself down with a gasp of satisfaction upon one of them it was unmade but that troubled me not at all i drew the clothes over my shivering body and in a moment i was in a deep sleep it was morning when i wakened and it seemed to me that instead of coming out into a world of sanity i had emerged into some extraordinary nightmare the african sun flooded through the big curtainless windows and every detail of the great bare whitewashed dormitory stood out hard and clear in front of me was standing a small dwarf-like man with a huge bulbous head who was jabbering excitedly in dutch waving two horrible hands which looked to me like brown sponges behind him stood a group of people who seemed to be intensely amused by the situation but a chill came over me as i looked at them not one of them was a normal human being every one was twisted or swollen or disfigured in some strange way the laughter of these strange monstrosities was a dreadful thing to hear it seemed that none of them could speak english but the situation wanted clearing up for the creature with the big head was growing furiously angry and uttering wild beast cries he had laid his deformed hands upon me and was dragging me out of bed regardless of the fresh flow of blood from my wound the little monster was as strong as a bull and i don't know what he might have done to me had not an elderly man who was clearly in authority been attracted to the room by the hubbub he said a few stern words in dutch and my persecutor shrank away then he turned upon me gazing at me in the utmost amazement 'how in the world did you come here' he asked in amazement 'wait a bit i see that you are tired out and that wounded shoulder of yours wants looking after i am a doctor and i'll soon have you tied up but man alive you are in far greater danger here than ever you were on the battlefield you are in the leper hospital and you have slept in a leper's bed' need i tell you more jimmie it seems that in view of the approaching battle all these poor creatures had been evacuated the day before then as the british advanced they had been brought back by this their medical superintendent who assured me that though he believed he was immune to the disease he would none the less never have dared to do what i had done he put me in a private room treated me kindly and within a week or so i was removed to the general hospital at pretoria so there you have my tragedy i hoped against hope but it was not until i had reached home that the terrible signs which you see upon my face told me that i had not escaped what was i to do i was in this lonely house we had two servants whom we could utterly trust there was a house where i could live under pledge of secrecy mr kent who is a surgeon was prepared to stay with me it seemed simple enough on those lines the alternative was a dreadful one--segregation for life among strangers with never a hope of release but absolute secrecy was necessary or even in this quiet country-side there would have been an outcry and i should have been dragged to my horrible doom even you jimmie--even you had to be kept in the dark why my father has relented i cannot imagine colonel emsworth pointed to me this is the gentleman who forced my hand he unfolded the scrap of paper on which i had written the word leprosy it seemed to me that if he knew so much as that it was safer that he should know all and so it was said i who knows but good may come of it i understand that only mr kent has seen the patient may i ask sir if you are an authority on such complaints which are i understand tropical or semi-tropical in their nature i have the ordinary knowledge of the educated medical man he observed with some stiffness i have no doubt sir that you are fully competent but i am sure that you will agree that in such a case a second opinion is valuable you have avoided this i understand for fear that pressure should be put upon you to segregate the patient that is so said colonel emsworth i foresaw this situation i explained and i have brought with me a friend whose discretion may absolutely be trusted i was able once to do him a professional service and he is ready to advise as a friend rather than as a specialist his name is sir james saunders the prospect of an interview with lord roberts would not have excited greater wonder and pleasure in a raw subaltern than was now reflected upon the face of mr kent i shall indeed be proud he murmured then i will ask sir james to step this way he is at present in the carriage outside the door meanwhile colonel emsworth we may perhaps assemble in your study where i could give the necessary explanations and here it is that i miss my watson by cunning questions and ejaculations of wonder he could elevate my simple art which is but systematized common sense into a prodigy when i tell my own story i have no such aid and yet i will give my process of thought even as i gave it to my small audience which included godfrey's mother in the study of colonel emsworth that process said i starts upon the supposition that when you have eliminated all which is impossible then whatever remains however improbable must be the truth it may well be that several explanations remain in which case one tries test after test until one or other of them has a convincing amount of support we will now apply this principle to the case in point as it was first presented to me there were three possible explanations of the seclusion or incarceration of this gentleman in an outhouse of his father's mansion there was the explanation that he was in hiding for a crime or that he was mad and that they wished to avoid an asylum or that he had some disease which caused his segregation i could think of no other adequate solutions these then had to be sifted and balanced against each other the criminal solution would not bear inspection no unsolved crime had been reported from that district i was sure of that if it were some crime not yet discovered then clearly it would be to the interest of the family to get rid of the delinquent and send him abroad rather than keep him concealed at home i could see no explanation for such a line of conduct insanity was more plausible the presence of the second person in the outhouse suggested a keeper the fact that he locked the door when he came out strengthened the supposition and gave the idea of constraint on the other hand this constraint could not be severe or the young man could not have got loose and come down to have a look at his friend you will remember mr dodd that i felt round for points asking you for example about the paper which mr kent was reading had it been _the lancet_ or _the british medical journal_ it would have helped me it is not illegal however to keep a lunatic upon private premises so long as there is a qualified person in attendance and that the authorities have been duly notified why then all this desperate desire for secrecy once again i could not get the theory to fit the facts there remained the third possibility into which rare and unlikely as it was everything seemed to fit leprosy is not uncommon in south africa by some extraordinary chance this youth might have contracted it his people would be placed in a very dreadful position since they would desire to save him from segregation great secrecy would be needed to prevent rumours from getting about and subsequent interference by the authorities a devoted medical man if sufficiently paid would easily be found to take charge of the sufferer there would be no reason why the latter should not be allowed freedom after dark bleaching of the skin is a common result of the disease the case was a strong one--so strong that i determined to act as if it were actually proved when on arriving here i noticed that ralph who carries out the meals had gloves which are impregnated with disinfectants my last doubts were removed a single word showed you sir that your secret was discovered and if i wrote rather than said it it was to prove to you that my discretion was to be trusted i was finishing this little analysis of the case when the door was opened and the austere figure of the great dermatologist was ushered in but for once his sphinx-like features had relaxed and there was a warm humanity in his eyes he strode up to colonel emsworth and shook him by the hand it is often my lot to bring ill-tidings and seldom good said he this occasion is the more welcome it is not leprosy what a well-marked case of pseudo-leprosy or ichthyosis a scale-like affection of the skin unsightly obstinate but possibly curable and certainly non-infective yes mr holmes the coincidence is a remarkable one but is it coincidence are there not subtle forces at work of which we know little are we assured that the apprehension from which this young man has no doubt suffered terribly since his exposure to its contagion may not produce a physical effect which simulates that which it fears at any rate i pledge my professional reputation---- but the lady has fainted i think that mr kent had better be with her until she recovers from this joyous shock iii the adventure of the mazarin stone it was pleasant to dr watson to find himself once more in the untidy room of the first floor in baker street which had been the starting-point of so many remarkable adventures he looked round him at the scientific charts upon the wall the acid-charred bench of chemicals the violin-case leaning in the corner the coal-scuttle which contained of old the pipes and tobacco finally his eyes came round to the fresh and smiling face of billy the young but very wise and tactful page who had helped a little to fill up the gap of loneliness and isolation which surrounded the saturnine figure of the great detective it all seems very unchanged billy you don't change either i hope the same can be said of him billy glanced with some solicitude at the closed door of the bedroom i think he's in bed and asleep he said it was seven in the evening of a lovely summer's day but dr watson was sufficiently familiar with the irregularity of his old friend's hours to feel no surprise at the idea that means a case i suppose yes sir he is very hard at it just now i'm frightened for his health he gets paler and thinner and he eats nothing 'when will you be pleased to dine mr holmes' mrs hudson asked 'seven-thirty the day after to-morrow' said he you know his way when he is keen on a case yes billy i know he's following someone yesterday he was out as a workman looking for a job to-day he was an old woman fairly took me in he did and i ought to know his ways by now billy pointed with a grin to a very baggy parasol which leaned against the sofa that's part of the old woman's outfit he said but what is it all about billy billy sank his voice as one who discusses great secrets of state i don't mind telling you sir but it should go no farther it's this case of the crown diamond what--the hundred-thousand-pound burglary yes sir they must get it back sir why we had the prime minister and the home secretary both sitting on that very sofa mr holmes was very nice to them he soon put them at their ease and promised he would do all he could then there is lord cantlemere---- ah yes sir you know what that means he's a stiff 'un sir if i may say so i can get along with the prime minister and i've nothing against the home secretary who seemed a civil obliging sort of man but i can't stand his lordship neither can mr holmes sir you see he don't believe in mr holmes and he was against employing him he'd rather he failed and mr holmes knows it mr holmes always knows whatever there is to know well we'll hope he won't fail and that lord cantlemere will be confounded but i say billy what is that curtain for across the window mr holmes had it put up there three days ago we've got something funny behind it billy advanced and drew away the drapery which screened the alcove of the bow window dr watson could not restrain a cry of amazement there was a facsimile of his old friend dressing-gown and all the face turned three-quarters towards the window and downwards as though reading an invisible book while the body was sunk deep in an arm-chair billy detached the head and held it in the air we put it at different angles so that it may seem more life-like i wouldn't dare touch it if the blind were not down but when it's up you can see this from across the way we used something of the sort once before before my time said billy he drew the window curtains apart and looked out into the street there are folk who watch us from over yonder i can see a fellow now at the window have a look for yourself watson had taken a step forward when the bedroom door opened and the long thin form of holmes emerged his face pale and drawn but his step and bearing as active as ever with a single spring he was at the window and had drawn the blind once more that will do billy said he you were in danger of your life then my boy and i can't do without you just yet well watson it is good to see you in your old quarters once again you come at a critical moment so i gather you can go billy that boy is a problem watson how far am i justified in allowing him to be in danger danger of what holmes of sudden death i'm expecting something this evening expecting what to be murdered watson no no you are joking holmes even my limited sense of humour could evolve a better joke than that but we may be comfortable in the meantime may we not is alcohol permitted the gasogene and cigars are in the old place let me see you once more in the customary arm-chair you have not i hope learned to despise my pipe and my lamentable tobacco it has to take the place of food these days but why not eat because the faculties become refined when you starve them why surely as a doctor my dear watson you must admit that what your digestion gains in the way of blood supply is so much lost to the brain i am a brain watson the rest of me is a mere appendix therefore it is the brain i must consider but this danger holmes ah yes in case it should come off it would perhaps be as well that you should burden your memory with the name and address of the murderer you can give it to scotland yard with my love and a parting blessing sylvius is the name--count negretto sylvius write it down man write it down 136 moorside gardens nw got it watson's honest face was twitching with anxiety he knew only too well the immense risks taken by holmes and was well aware that what he said was more likely to be under-statement than exaggeration watson was always the man of action and he rose to the occasion count me in holmes i have nothing to do for a day or two your morals don't improve watson you have added fibbing to your other vices you bear every sign of the busy medical man with calls on him every hour not such important ones but can't you have this fellow arrested yes watson i could that's what worries him so but why don't you because i don't know where the diamond is ah billy told me--the missing crown jewel yes the great yellow mazarin stone i've cast my net and i have my fish but i have not got the stone what is the use of taking _them_ we can make the world a better place by laying them by the heels but that is not what i am out for it's the stone i want and is this count sylvius one of your fish yes and he's a shark he bites the other is sam merton the boxer not a bad fellow sam but the count has used him sam's not a shark he is a great big silly bull-headed gudgeon but he is flopping about in my net all the same where is this count sylvius i've been at his very elbow all the morning you've seen me as an old lady watson i was never more convincing he actually picked up my parasol for me once 'by your leave madame' said he--half-italian you know and with the southern graces of manner when in the mood but a devil incarnate in the other mood life is full of whimsical happenings watson it might have been tragedy well perhaps it might i followed him to old straubenzee's workshop in the minories straubenzee made the air-gun--a very pretty bit of work as i understand and i rather fancy it is in the opposite window at the present moment have you seen the dummy of course billy showed it to you well it may get a bullet through its beautiful head at any moment ah billy what is it the boy had reappeared in the room with a card upon a tray holmes glanced at it with raised eyebrows and an amused smile the man himself i had hardly expected this grasp the nettle watson a man of nerve possibly you have heard of his reputation as a shooter of big game it would indeed be a triumphant ending to his excellent sporting record if he added me to his bag this is a proof that he feels my toe very close behind his heel send for the police i probably shall but not just yet would you glance carefully out of the window watson and see if anyone is hanging about in the street watson looked warily round the edge of the curtain yes there is one rough fellow near the door that will be sam merton--the faithful but rather fatuous sam where is this gentleman billy in the waiting-room sir show him up when i ring yes sir if i am not in the room show him in all the same yes sir watson waited until the door was closed and then he turned earnestly to his companion look here holmes this is simply impossible this is a desperate man who sticks at nothing he may have come to murder you i should not be surprised i insist upon staying with you you would be horribly in the way in his way no my dear fellow--in my way well i can't possibly leave you yes you can watson and you will for you have never failed to play the game i am sure you will play it to the end this man has come for his own purpose but he may stay for mine holmes took out his notebook and scribbled a few lines take a cab to scotland yard and give this to youghal of the cid come back with the police the fellow's arrest will follow i'll do that with joy before you return i may have just time enough to find out where the stone is he touched the bell i think we will go out through the bedroom this second exit is exceedingly useful i rather want to see my shark without his seeing me and i have as you will remember my own way of doing it it was therefore an empty room into which billy a minute later ushered count sylvius the famous game-shot sportsman and man-about-town was a big swarthy fellow with a formidable dark moustache shading a cruel thin-lipped mouth and surmounted by a long curved nose like the beak of an eagle he was well dressed but his brilliant necktie shining pin and glittering rings were flamboyant in their effect as the door closed behind him he looked round him with fierce startled eyes like one who suspects a trap at every turn then he gave a violent start as he saw the impassive head and the collar of the dressing-gown which projected above the arm-chair in the window at first his expression was one of pure amazement then the light of a horrible hope gleamed in his dark murderous eyes he took one more glance round to see that there were no witnesses and then on tiptoe his thick stick half raised he approached the silent figure he was crouching for his final spring and blow when a cool sardonic voice greeted him from the open bedroom door don't break it count don't break it the assassin staggered back amazement in his convulsed face for an instant he half raised his loaded cane once more as if he would turn his violence from the effigy to the original but there was something in that steady grey eye and mocking smile which caused his hand to sink to his side it's a pretty little thing said holmes advancing towards the image tavernier the french modeller made it he is as good at waxworks as your friend straubenzee is at air-guns air-guns sir what do you mean put your hat and stick on the side-table thank you pray take a seat would you care to put your revolver out also oh very good if you prefer to sit upon it your visit is really most opportune for i wanted badly to have a few minutes' chat with you the count scowled with heavy threatening eyebrows i too wished to have some words with you holmes that is why i am here i won't deny that i intended to assault you just now holmes swung his leg on the edge of the table i rather gathered that you had some idea of the sort in your head said he but why these personal attentions because you have gone out of your way to annoy me because you have put your creatures upon my track my creatures i assure you no nonsense i have had them followed two can play at that game holmes it is a small point count sylvius but perhaps you would kindly give me my prefix when you address me you can understand that with my routine of work i should find myself on familiar terms with half the rogues' gallery and you will agree that exceptions are invidious well _mr_ holmes then excellent but i assure you you are mistaken about my alleged agents count sylvius laughed contemptuously other people can observe as well as you yesterday there was an old sporting man to-day it was an elderly woman they held me in view all day really sir you compliment me old baron dowson said the night before he was hanged that in my case what the law had gained the stage had lost and now you give my little impersonations your kindly praise it was you--you yourself holmes shrugged his shoulders you can see in the corner the parasol which you so politely handed to me in the minories before you began to suspect if i had known you might never---- have seen this humble home again i was well aware of it we all have neglected opportunities to deplore as it happens you did not know so here we are the count's knotted brows gathered more heavily over his menacing eyes what you say only makes the matter worse it was not your agents but your play-acting busybody self you admit that you have dogged me why come now count you used to shoot lions in algeria well but why why the sport--the excitement--the danger and no doubt to free the country from a pest exactly my reasons in a nutshell the count sprang to his feet and his hand involuntarily moved back to his hip-pocket sit down sir sit down there was another more practical reason i want that yellow diamond count sylvius lay back in his chair with an evil smile upon my word said he you knew that i was after you for that the real reason why you are here to-night is to find out how much i know about the matter and how far my removal is absolutely essential well i should say that from your point of view it is absolutely essential for i know all about it save only one thing which you are about to tell me oh indeed and pray what is this missing fact where the crown diamond now is the count looked sharply at his companion oh you want to know that do you how the devil should i be able to tell you where it is you can and you will indeed you can't bluff me count sylvius holmes's eyes as he gazed at him contracted and lightened until they were like two menacing points of steel you are absolute plate-glass i see to the very back of your mind then of course you see where the diamond is holmes clapped his hands with amusement and then pointed a derisive finger then you do know you have admitted it i admit nothing now count if you will be reasonable we can do business if not you will get hurt count sylvius threw up his eyes to the ceiling and you talk about bluff said he holmes looked at him thoughtfully like a master chess-player who meditates his crowning move then he threw open the table drawer and drew out a squat notebook do you know what i keep in this book no sir i do not you me yes sir _you_ you are all here--every action of your vile and dangerous life damn you holmes cried the count with blazing eyes there are limits to my patience it's all here count the real facts as to the death of old mrs harold who left you the blymer estate which you so rapidly gambled away you are dreaming and the complete life history of miss minnie warrender tut you will make nothing of that plenty more here count here is the robbery in the train-de-luxe to the riviera on february 13 1892 here is the forged cheque in the same year on the crédit lyonnais no you're wrong there then i am right on the others now count you are a card-player when the other fellow has all the trumps it saves time to throw down your hand what has all this talk to do with the jewel of which you spoke gently count restrain that eager mind let me get to the points in my own humdrum fashion i have all this against you but above all i have a clear case against both you and your fighting bully in the case of the crown diamond indeed i have the cabman who took you to whitehall and the cabman who brought you away i have the commissionaire who saw you near the case i have ikey sanders who refused to cut it up for you ikey has peached and the game is up the veins stood out on the count's forehead his dark hairy hands were clenched in a convulsion of restrained emotion he tried to speak but the words would not shape themselves that's the hand i play from said holmes i put it all upon the table but one card is missing it's the king of diamonds i don't know where the stone is you never shall know no now be reasonable count consider the situation you are going to be locked up for twenty years so is sam merton what good are you going to get out of your diamond none in the world but if you hand it over--well i'll compound a felony we don't want you or sam we want the stone give that up and so far as i am concerned you can go free so long as you behave yourself in the future if you make another slip--well it will be the last but this time my commission is to get the stone not you but if i refuse why then--alas--it must be you and not the stone billy had appeared in answer to a ring i think count that it would be as well to have your friend sam at this conference after all his interests should be represented billy you will see a large and ugly gentleman outside the front door ask him to come up if he won't come sir no violence billy don't be rough with him if you tell him that count sylvius wants him he will certainly come what are you going to do now asked the count as billy disappeared my friend watson was with me just now i told him that i had a shark and a gudgeon in my net now i am drawing the net and up they come together the count had risen from his chair and his hand was behind his back holmes held something half protruding from the pocket of his dressing-gown you won't die in your bed holmes i have often had the same idea does it matter very much after all count your own exit is more likely to be perpendicular than horizontal but these anticipations of the future are morbid why not give ourselves up to the unrestrained enjoyment of the present a sudden wild-beast light sprang up in the dark menacing eyes of the master criminal holmes's figure seemed to grow taller as he grew tense and ready it is no use your fingering your revolver my friend he said in a quiet voice you know perfectly well that you dare not use it even if i gave you time to draw it nasty noisy things revolvers count better stick to air-guns ah i think i hear the fairy footstep of your estimable partner good day mr merton rather dull in the street is it not the prize-fighter a heavily built young man with a stupid obstinate slab-sided face stood awkwardly at the door looking about him with a puzzled expression holmes's debonair manner was a new experience and though he vaguely felt that it was hostile he did not know how to counter it he turned to his more astute comrade for help what's the game now count what's this fellow want what's up his voice was deep and raucous the count shrugged his shoulders and it was holmes who answered if i may put it in a nutshell mr merton i should say it was _all_ up the boxer still addressed his remarks to his associate is this cove trying to be funny or what i'm not in the funny mood myself no i expect not said holmes i think i can promise you that you will feel even less humorous as the evening advances now look here count sylvius i'm a busy man and i can't waste time i'm going into that bedroom pray make yourselves quite at home in my absence you can explain to your friend how the matter lies without the restraint of my presence i shall try over the hoffmann barcarolle upon my violin in five minutes i shall return for your final answer you quite grasp the alternative do you not shall we take you or shall we have the stone holmes withdrew picking up his violin from the corner as he passed a few moments later the long-drawn wailing notes of that most haunting of tunes came faintly through the closed door of the bedroom what is it then asked merton anxiously as his companion turned to him does he know about the stone he knows a damned sight too much about it i'm not sure that he doesn't know all about it good lord the boxer's sallow face turned a shade whiter ikey sanders has split on us he has has he i'll do him down a thick 'un for that if i swing for it that won't help us much we've got to make up our minds what to do half a mo' said the boxer looking suspiciously at the bedroom door he's a leary cove that wants watching i suppose he's not listening how can he be listening with that music going that's right maybe somebody's behind a curtain too many curtains in this room as he looked round he suddenly saw for the first time the effigy in the window and stood staring and pointing too amazed for words tut it's only a dummy said the count a fake is it well strike me madame tussaud ain't in it it's the living spit of him gown and all but them curtains count oh confound the curtains we are wasting our time and there is none too much he can lag us over this stone the deuce he can but he'll let us slip if we only tell him where the swag is what give it up give up a hundred thousand quid it's one or the other merton scratched his short-cropped pate he's alone in there let's do him in if his light were out we should have nothing to fear the count shook his head he is armed and ready if we shot him we could hardly get away in a place like this besides it's likely enough that the police know whatever evidence he has got hallo what was that there was a vague sound which seemed to come from the window both men sprang round but all was quiet save for the one strange figure seated in the chair the room was certainly empty something in the street said merton now look here guv'nor you've got the brains surely you can think a way out of it if slugging is no use then it's up to you i've fooled better men than he the count answered the stone is here in my secret pocket i take no chances leaving it about it can be out of england to-night and cut into four pieces in amsterdam before sunday he knows nothing of van seddar i thought van seddar was going next week he _was_ but now he must get off by the next boat one or other of us must slip round with the stone to lime street and tell him but the false bottom ain't ready well he must take it as it is and chance it there's not a moment to lose again with the sense of danger which becomes an instinct with the sportsman he paused and looked hard at the window yes it was surely from the street that the faint sound had come as to holmes he continued we can fool him easily enough you see the damned fool won't arrest us if he can get the stone well we'll promise him the stone we'll put him on the wrong track about it and before he finds that it is the wrong track it will be in holland and we out of the country that sounds good to me cried sam merton with a grin you go on and tell the dutchman to get a move on him i'll see this sucker and fill him up with a bogus confession i'll tell him that the stone is in liverpool confound that whining music it gets on my nerves by the time he finds it isn't in liverpool it will be in quarters and we on the blue water come back here out of a line with that keyhole here is the stone i wonder you dare carry it where could i have it safer if we could take it out of whitehall someone else could surely take it out of my lodgings let's have a look at it count sylvius cast a somewhat unflattering glance at his associate and disregarded the unwashed hand which was extended towards him what--d'ye think i'm going to snatch it off you see here mister i'm getting a bit tired of your ways well well no offence sam we can't afford to quarrel come over to the window if you want to see the beauty properly now hold it to the light here thank you with a single spring holmes had leaped from the dummy's chair and had grasped the precious jewel he held it now in one hand while his other pointed a revolver at the count's head the two villains staggered back in utter amazement before they had recovered holmes had pressed the electric bell no violence gentlemen--no violence i beg of you consider the furniture it must be very clear to you that your position is an impossible one the police are waiting below the count's bewilderment overmastered his rage and fear but how the deuce---- he gasped your surprise is very natural you are not aware that a second door from my bedroom leads behind that curtain i fancied that you must have heard me when i displaced the figure but luck was on my side it gave me a chance of listening to your racy conversation which would have been painfully constrained had you been aware of my presence the count gave a gesture of resignation we give you best holmes i believe you are the devil himself not far from him at any rate holmes answered with a polite smile sam merton's slow intellect had only gradually appreciated the situation now as the sound of heavy steps came from the stairs outside he broke silence at last a fair cop said he but i say what about that bloomin' fiddle i hear it yet tut tut holmes answered you are perfectly right let it play these modern gramophones are a remarkable invention there was an inrush of police the handcuffs clicked and the criminals were led to the waiting cab watson lingered with holmes congratulating him upon this fresh leaf added to his laurels once more their conversation was interrupted by the imperturbable billy with his card-tray lord cantlemere sir show him up billy this is the eminent peer who represents the very highest interests said holmes he is an excellent and loyal person but rather of the old regime shall we make him unbend dare we venture upon a slight liberty he knows we may conjecture nothing of what has occurred the door opened to admit a thin austere figure with a hatchet face and drooping mid-victorian whiskers of a glossy blackness which hardly corresponded with the rounded shoulders and feeble gait holmes advanced affably and shook an unresponsive hand how-do-you-do lord cantlemere it is chilly for the time of year but rather warm indoors may i take your overcoat no i thank you i will not take it off holmes laid his hand insistently upon the sleeve pray allow me my friend dr watson would assure you that these changes of temperature are most insidious his lordship shook himself free with some impatience i am quite comfortable sir i have no need to stay i have simply looked in to know how your self-appointed task was progressing it is difficult--very difficult i feared that you would find it so there was a distinct sneer in the old courtier's words and manner every man finds his limitations mr holmes but at least it cures us of the weakness of self-satisfaction yes sir i have been much perplexed no doubt especially upon one point possibly you could help me upon it you apply for my advice rather late in the day i thought that you had your own all-sufficient methods still i am ready to help you you see lord cantlemere we can no doubt frame a case against the actual thieves when you have caught them exactly but the question is--how shall we proceed against the receiver is this not rather premature it is as well to have our plans ready now what would you regard as final evidence against the receiver the actual possession of the stone you would arrest him upon that most undoubtedly holmes seldom laughed but he got as near it as his old friend watson could remember in that case my dear sir i shall be under the painful necessity of advising your arrest lord cantlemere was very angry some of the ancient fires flickered up into his sallow cheeks you take a great liberty mr holmes in fifty years of official life i cannot recall such a case i am a busy man sir engaged upon important affairs and i have no time or taste for foolish jokes i may tell you frankly sir that i have never been a believer in your powers and that i have always been of the opinion that the matter was far safer in the hands of the regular police force your conduct confirms all my conclusions i have the honour sir to wish you good evening holmes had swiftly changed his position and was between the peer and the door one moment sir said he to actually go off with the mazarin stone would be a more serious offence than to be found in temporary possession of it sir this is intolerable let me pass put your hand in the right-hand pocket of your overcoat what do you mean sir come--come do what i ask an instant later the amazed peer was standing blinking and stammering with the great yellow stone on his shaking palm what what how is this mr holmes too bad lord cantlemere too bad cried holmes my old friend here will tell you that i have an impish habit of practical joking also that i can never resist a dramatic situation i took the liberty--the very great liberty i admit--of putting the stone into your pocket at the beginning of our interview the old peer stared from the stone to the smiling face before him sir i am bewildered but--yes--it is indeed the mazarin stone we are greatly your debtors mr holmes your sense of humour may as you admit be somewhat perverted and its exhibition remarkably untimely but at least i withdraw any reflection i have made upon your amazing professional powers but how---- the case is but half finished the details can wait no doubt lord cantlemere your pleasure in telling of this successful result in the exalted circle to which you return will be some small atonement for my practical joke billy you will show his lordship out and tell mrs hudson that i should be glad if she would send up dinner for two as soon as possible iv the adventure of the three gables i don't think that any of my adventures with mr sherlock holmes opened quite so abruptly or so dramatically as that which i associate with the three gables i had not seen holmes for some days and had no idea of the new channel into which his activities had been directed he was in a chatty mood that morning however and had just settled me into the well-worn low arm-chair on one side of the fire while he had curled down with his pipe in his mouth upon the opposite chair when our visitor arrived if i had said that a mad bull had arrived it would give a clearer impression of what occurred the door had flown open and a huge negro had burst into the room he would have been a comic figure if he had not been terrific for he was dressed in a very loud grey check suit with a flowing salmon-coloured tie his broad face and flattened nose were thrust forward as his sullen dark eyes with a smouldering gleam of malice in them turned from one of us to the other which of you genelmen is masser holmes he asked holmes raised his pipe with a languid smile oh it's you is it said our visitor coming with an unpleasant stealthy step round the angle of the table see here masser holmes you keep your hands out of other folks' business leave folks to manage their own affairs got that masser holmes keep on talking said holmes it's fine oh it's fine is it growled the savage it won't be so damn fine if i have to trim you up a bit i've handled your kind before now and they didn't look fine when i was through with them look at that masser holmes he swung a huge knotted lump of a fist under my friend's nose holmes examined it closely with an air of great interest were you born so he asked or did it come by degrees it may have been the icy coolness of my friend or it may have been the slight clatter which i made as i picked up the poker in any case our visitor's manner became less flamboyant well i've given you fair warnin' said he i've a friend that's interested out harrow way--you know what i'm meaning--and he don't intend to have no buttin' in by you got that you ain't the law and i ain't the law either and if you come in i'll be on hand also don't you forget it i've wanted to meet you for some time said holmes i won't ask you to sit down for i don't like the smell of you but aren't you steve dixie the bruiser that's my name masser holmes and you'll get put through it for sure if you give me any lip it is certainly the last thing you need said holmes staring at our visitor's hideous mouth but it was the killing of young perkins outside the holborn bar---- what you're not going the negro had sprung back and his face was leaden i won't listen to no such talk said he what have i to do with this 'ere perkins masser holmes i was trainin' at the bull ring in birmingham when this boy done gone get into trouble yes you'll tell the magistrate about it steve said holmes i've been watching you and barney stockdale---- so help me the lord masser holmes---- that's enough get out of it i'll pick you up when i want you good mornin' masser holmes i hope there ain't no hard feelin's about this 'ere visit there will be unless you tell me who sent you why there ain't no secret about that masser holmes it was that same genelman that you have just done gone mention and who set him on to it s'elp me i don't know masser holmes he just say 'steve you go see mr holmes and tell him his life ain't safe if he go down harrow way' that's the whole truth without waiting for any further questioning our visitor bolted out of the room almost as precipitately as he had entered holmes knocked out the ashes of his pipe with a quiet chuckle i am glad you were not forced to break his woolly head watson i observed your manoeuvres with the poker but he is really rather a harmless fellow a great muscular foolish blustering baby and easily cowed as you have seen he is one of the spencer john gang and has taken part in some dirty work of late which i may clear up when i have time his immediate principal barney is a more astute person they specialize in assaults intimidation and the like what i want to know is who is at the back of them on this particular occasion but why do they want to intimidate you it is this harrow weald case it decides me to look into the matter for if it is worth anyone's while to take so much trouble there must be something in it but what is it i was going to tell you when we had this comic interlude here is mrs maberley's note if you care to come with me we will wire her and go out at once dear mr sherlock holmes i read-- i have had a succession of strange incidents occur to me in connection with this house and i should much value your advice you would find me at home any time to-morrow the house is within a short walk of the weald station i believe that my late husband mortimer maberley was one of your early clients yours faithfully mary maberley the address was the three gables harrow weald so that's that said holmes and now if you can spare the time watson we will get upon our way a short railway journey and a shorter drive brought us to the house a brick and timber villa standing in its own acre of undeveloped grassland three small projections above the upper windows made a feeble attempt to justify its name behind was a grove of melancholy half-grown pines and the whole aspect of the place was poor and depressing none the less we found the house to be well furnished and the lady who received us was a most engaging elderly person who bore every mark of refinement and culture i remember your husband well madam said holmes though it is some years since he used my services in some trifling matter probably you would be more familiar with the name of my son douglas holmes looked at her with great interest dear me are you the mother of douglas maberley i knew him slightly but of course all london knew him what a magnificent creature he was where is he now dead mr holmes dead he was attaché at rome and he died there of pneumonia last month i am sorry one could not connect death with such a man i have never known anyone so vitally alive he lived intensely--every fibre of him too intensely mr holmes that was the ruin of him you remember him as he was--debonair and splendid you did not see the moody morose brooding creature into which he developed his heart was broken in a single month i seemed to see my gallant boy turn into a worn-out cynical man a love affair--a woman or a fiend well it was not to talk of my poor lad that i asked you to come mr holmes dr watson and i are at your service there have been some very strange happenings i have been in this house more than a year now and as i wished to lead a retired life i have seen little of my neighbours three days ago i had a call from a man who said that he was a house agent he said that this house would exactly suit a client of his and that if i would part with it money would be no object it seemed to me very strange as there are several empty houses on the market which appear to be equally eligible but naturally i was interested in what he said i therefore named a price which was five hundred pounds more than i gave he at once closed with the offer but added that his client desired to buy the furniture as well and would i put a price upon it some of this furniture is from my old home and it is as you see very good so that i named a good round sum to this also he at once agreed i had always wanted to travel and the bargain was so good a one that it really seemed that i should be my own mistress for the rest of my life yesterday the man arrived with the agreement all drawn out luckily i showed it to mr sutro my lawyer who lives in harrow he said to me 'this is a very strange document are you aware that if you sign it you could not legally take _anything_ out of the house--not even your own private possessions' when the man came again in the evening i pointed this out and i said that i meant only to sell the furniture 'no no everything' said he 'but my clothes my jewels' 'well well some concession might be made for your personal effects but nothing shall go out of the house unchecked my client is a very liberal man but he has his fads and his own way of doing things it is everything or nothing with him' 'then it must be nothing' said i and there the matter was left but the whole thing seemed to me to be so unusual that i thought---- here we had a very extraordinary interruption holmes raised his hand for silence then he strode across the room flung open the door and dragged in a great gaunt woman whom he had seized by the shoulder she entered with ungainly struggles like some huge awkward chicken torn squawking out of its coop leave me alone what are you a-doin' of she screeched why susan what is this well ma'am i was comin' in to ask if the visitors was stayin' for lunch when this man jumped out at me i have been listening to her for the last five minutes but did not wish to interrupt your most interesting narrative just a little wheezy susan are you not you breathe too heavily for that kind of work susan turned a sulky but amazed face upon her captor who be you anyhow and what right have you a-pullin' me about like this it was merely that i wished to ask a question in your presence did you mrs maberley mention to anyone that you were going to write to me and consult me no mr holmes i did not who posted your letter susan did exactly now susan to whom was it that you wrote or sent a message to say that your mistress was asking advice from me it's a lie i sent no message now susan wheezy people may not live long you know it's a wicked thing to tell fibs whom did you tell susan cried her mistress i believe you are a bad treacherous woman i remember now that i saw you speaking to someone over the hedge that was my own business said the woman sullenly suppose i tell you that it was barney stockdale to whom you spoke said holmes well if you know what do you want to ask for i was not sure but i know now well now susan it will be worth ten pounds to you if you will tell me who is at the back of barney someone that could lay down a thousand pounds for every ten you have in the world so a rich man no you smiled--a rich woman now we have got so far you may as well give the name and earn the tenner i'll see you in hell first oh susan language i am clearing out of here i've had enough of you all i'll send for my box to-morrow she flounced for the door good-bye susan paregoric is the stuff now he continued turning suddenly from lively to severe when the door had closed behind the flushed and angry woman this gang means business look how close they play the game your letter to me had the 10 pm postmark and yet susan passes the word to barney barney has time to go to his employer and get instructions he or she--i incline to the latter from susan's grin when she thought i had blundered--forms a plan black steve is called in and i am warned off by eleven o'clock next morning that's quick work you know but what do they want yes that's the question who had the house before you a retired sea captain called ferguson anything remarkable about him not that ever i heard of i was wondering whether he could have buried something of course when people bury treasure nowadays they do it in the post office bank but there are always some lunatics about it would be a dull world without them at first i thought of some buried valuable but why in that case should they want your furniture you don't happen to have a raphael or a first folio shakespeare without knowing it no i don't think i have anything rarer than a crown derby tea-set that would hardly justify all this mystery besides why should they not openly state what they want if they covet your tea-set they can surely offer a price for it without buying you out lock stock and barrel no as i read it there is something which you do not know that you have and which you would not give up if you did know that is how i read it said i dr watson agrees so that settles it well mr holmes what can it be let us see whether by this purely mental analysis we can get it to a finer point you have been in this house a year nearly two all the better during this long period no one wants anything from you now suddenly within three or four days you have urgent demands what would you gather from that it can only mean said i that the object whatever it may be has only just come into the house settled once again said holmes now mrs maberley has any object just arrived no i have bought nothing new this year indeed that is very remarkable well i think we had best let matters develop a little further until we have clearer data is that lawyer of yours a capable man mr sutro is most capable have you another maid or was the fair susan who has just banged your front door alone i have a young girl try and get sutro to spend a night or two in the house you might possibly want protection against whom who knows the matter is certainly obscure if i can't find what they are after i must approach the matter from the other end and try to get at the principal did this house-agent man give any address simply his card and occupation haines-johnson auctioneer and valuer i don't think we shall find him in the directory honest business men don't conceal their place of business well you will let me know any fresh development i have taken up your case and you may rely upon it that i shall see it through as we passed through the hall holmes's eyes which missed nothing lighted upon several trunks and cases which were piled in the corner the labels shone out upon them 'milano' 'lucerne' these are from italy they are poor douglas's things you have not unpacked them how long have you had them they arrived last week but you said--why surely this might be the missing link how do we know that there is not something of value there there could not possibly be mr holmes poor douglas had only his pay and a small annuity what could he have of value holmes was lost in thought delay no longer mrs maberley he said at last have these things taken upstairs to your bedroom examine them as soon as possible and see what they contain i will come to-morrow and hear your report it was quite evident that the three gables was under very close surveillance for as we came round the high hedge at the end of the lane there was the negro prize-fighter standing in the shadow we came on him quite suddenly and a grim and menacing figure he looked in that lonely place holmes clapped his hand to his pocket lookin' for your gun masser holmes no for my scent-bottle steve you are funny masser holmes ain't you it won't be funny for you steve if i get after you i gave you fair warning this morning well masser holmes i done gone think over what you said and i don't want no more talk about that affair of masser perkins s'pose i can help you masser holmes i will well then tell me who is behind you on this job so help me the lord masser holmes i told you the truth before i don't know my boss barney gives me orders and that's all well just bear in mind steve that the lady in that house and everything under that roof is under my protection don't you forget it all right masser holmes i'll remember' i've got him thoroughly frightened for his own skin watson holmes remarked as we walked on i think he would double-cross his employer if he knew who he was it was lucky i had some knowledge of the spencer john crowd and that steve was one of them now watson this is a case for langdale pike and i am going to see him now when i get back i may be clearer in the matter i saw no more of holmes during the day but i could well imagine how he spent it for langdale pike was his human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal this strange languid creature spent his waking hours in the bow window of a st james's street club and was the receiving-station as well as the transmitter for all the gossip of the metropolis he made it was said a four-figure income by the paragraphs which he contributed every week to the garbage papers which cater for an inquisitive public if ever far down in the turbid depths of london life there was some strange swirl or eddy it was marked with automatic exactness by this human dial upon the surface holmes discreetly helped langdale to knowledge and on occasion was helped in turn when i met my friend in his room early next morning i was conscious from his bearing that all was well but none the less a most unpleasant surprise was awaiting us it took the shape of the following telegram please come out at once client's house burgled in the night police in possession sutro holmes whistled the drama has come to a crisis and quicker than i had expected there is a great driving-power at the back of this business watson which does not surprise me after what i have heard this sutro of course is her lawyer i made a mistake i fear in not asking you to spend the night on guard this fellow has clearly proved a broken reed well there is nothing for it but another journey to harrow weald we found the three gables a very different establishment to the orderly household of the previous day a small group of idlers had assembled at the garden gate while a couple of constables were examining the windows and the geranium beds within we met a grey old gentleman who introduced himself as the lawyer together with a bustling rubicund inspector who greeted holmes as an old friend well mr holmes no chance for you in this case i'm afraid just a common ordinary burglary and well within the capacity of the poor old police no experts need apply i am sure the case is in very good hands said holmes merely a common burglary you say quite so we know pretty well who the men are and where to find them it is that gang of barney stockdale with the big nigger in it--they've been seen about here excellent what did they get well they don't seem to have got much mrs maberley was chloroformed and the house was---- ah here is the lady herself our friend of yesterday looking very pale and ill had entered the room leaning upon a little maid-servant you gave me good advice mr holmes said she smiling ruefully alas i did not take it i did not wish to trouble mr sutro and so i was unprotected i only heard of it this morning the lawyer explained mr holmes advised me to have some friend in the house i neglected his advice and i have paid for it you look wretchedly ill said holmes perhaps you are hardly equal to telling me what occurred it is all here said the inspector tapping a bulky notebook still if the lady is not too exhausted---- there is really so little to tell i have no doubt that wicked susan had planned an entrance for them they must have known the house to an inch i was conscious for a moment of the chloroform rag which was thrust over my mouth but i have no notion how long i may have been senseless when i woke one man was at the bedside and another was rising with a bundle in his hand from among my son's baggage which was partially opened and littered over the floor before he could get away i sprang up and seized him you took a big risk said the inspector i clung to him but he shook me off and the other may have struck me for i can remember no more mary the maid heard the noise and began screaming out of the window that brought the police but the rascals had got away what did they take well i don't think there is anything of value missing i am sure there was nothing in my son's trunks did the men leave no clue there was one sheet of paper which i may have torn from the man that i grasped it was lying all crumpled on the floor it is in my son's handwriting which means that it is not of much use said the inspector now if it had been in the burglar's---- exactly said holmes what rugged common sense none the less i should be curious to see it the inspector drew a folded sheet of foolscap from his pocket-book i never pass anything however trifling said he with some pomposity that is my advice to you mr holmes in twenty-five years' experience i have learned my lesson there is always the chance of finger-marks or something holmes inspected the sheet of paper what do you make of it inspector seems to be the end of some queer novel so far as i can see it may certainly prove to be the end of a queer tale said holmes you have noticed the number on the top of the page it is two hundred and forty-five where are the odd two hundred and forty-four pages well i suppose the burglars got those much good may it do them it seems a queer thing to break into a house in order to steal such papers as that does it suggest anything to you inspector yes sir it suggests that in their hurry the rascals just grabbed at what came first to hand i wish them joy of what they got why should they go to my son's things asked mrs maberley well they found nothing valuable downstairs so they tried their luck upstairs that is how i read it what do you make of it mr holmes i must think it over inspector come to the window watson then as we stood together he read over the fragment of paper it began in the middle of a sentence and ran like this face bled considerably from the cuts and blows but it was nothing to the bleeding of his heart as he saw that lovely face the face for which he had been prepared to sacrifice his very life looking out at his agony and humiliation she smiled--yes by heaven she smiled like the heartless fiend she was as he looked up at her it was at that moment that love died and hate was born man must live for something if it is not for your embrace my lady then it shall surely be for your undoing and my complete revenge queer grammar said holmes with a smile as he handed the paper back to the inspector did you notice how the 'he' suddenly changed to 'my' the writer was so carried away by his own story that he imagined himself at the supreme moment to be the hero it seemed mighty poor stuff said the inspector as he replaced it in his book what are you off mr holmes i don't think there is anything more for me to do now that the case is in such capable hands by the way mrs maberley did you say you wished to travel it has always been my dream mr holmes where would you like to go--cairo madeira the riviera oh if i had the money i would go round the world quite so round the world well good morning i may drop you a line in the evening as we passed the window i caught a glimpse of the inspector's smile and shake of the head these clever fellows have always a touch of madness that was what i read in the inspector's smile now watson we are at the last lap of our little journey said holmes when we were back in the roar of central london once more i think we had best clear the matter up at once and it would be well that you should come with me for it is safer to have a witness when you are dealing with such a lady as isadora klein we had taken a cab and were speeding to some address in grosvenor square holmes had been sunk in thought but he roused himself suddenly by the way watson i suppose you see it all clearly no i can't say that i do i only gather that we are going to see the lady who is behind all this mischief exactly but does the name isadora klein convey nothing to you she was of course the celebrated beauty there was never a woman to touch her she is pure spanish the real blood of the masterful conquistadors and her people have been leaders in pernambuco for generations she married the aged german sugar king klein and presently found herself the richest as well as the most lovely widow upon earth then there was an interval of adventure when she pleased her own tastes she had several lovers and douglas maberley one of the most striking men in london was one of them it was by all accounts more than an adventure with him he was not a society butterfly but a strong proud man who gave and expected all but she is the '_belle dame sans merci_' of fiction when her caprice is satisfied the matter is ended and if the other party in the matter can't take her word for it she knows how to bring it home to him then that was his own story---- ah you are piecing it together now i hear that she is about to marry the young duke of lomond who might almost be her son his grace's ma might overlook the age but a big scandal would be a different matter so it is imperative---- ah here we are it was one of the finest corner-houses of the west end a machine-like footman took up our cards and returned with word that the lady was not at home then we shall wait until she is said holmes cheerfully the machine broke down not at home means not at home to _you_ said the footman good holmes answered that means that we shall not have to wait kindly give this note to your mistress he scribbled three or four words upon a sheet of his notebook folded it and handed it to the man what did you say holmes i asked i simply wrote 'shall it be the police then' i think that should pass us in it did--with amazing celerity a minute later we were in an arabian-nights' drawing-room vast and wonderful in a half gloom picked out with an occasional pink electric light the lady had come i felt to that time of life when even the proudest beauty finds the half-light more welcome she rose from a settee as we entered tall queenly a perfect figure a lovely mask-like face with two wonderful spanish eyes which looked murder at us both what is this intrusion--and this insulting message she asked holding up the slip of paper i need not explain madame i have too much respect for your intelligence to do so--though i confess that intelligence has been surprisingly at fault of late how so sir by supposing that your hired bullies could frighten me from my work surely no man would take up my profession if it were not that danger attracts him it was you then who forced me to examine the case of young maberley i have no idea what you are talking about what have i to do with hired bullies holmes turned away wearily yes i have underrated your intelligence well good afternoon stop where are you going to scotland yard we had not got half-way to the door before she had overtaken us and was holding his arm she had turned in a moment from steel to velvet come and sit down gentlemen let us talk this matter over i feel that i may be frank with you mr holmes you have the feelings of a gentleman how quick a woman's instinct is to find it out i will treat you as a friend i cannot promise to reciprocate madame i am not the law but i represent justice so far as my feeble powers go i am ready to listen and then i will tell you how i will act no doubt it was foolish of me to threaten a brave man like yourself what was really foolish madame is that you have placed yourself in the power of a band of rascals who may blackmail or give you away no no i am not so simple since i have promised to be frank i may say that no one save barney stockdale and susan his wife have the least idea who their employer is as to them well it is not the first---- she smiled and nodded with a charming coquettish intimacy i see you've tested them before they are good hounds who run silent such hounds have a way sooner or later of biting the hand that feeds them they will be arrested for this burglary the police are already after them they will take what comes to them that is what they are paid for i shall not appear in the matter unless i bring you into it no no you would not you are a gentleman it is a woman's secret in the first place you must give back this manuscript she broke into a ripple of laughter and walked to the fireplace there was a calcined mass which she broke up with the poker shall i give this back she asked so roguish and exquisite did she look as she stood before us with a challenging smile that i felt of all holmes's criminals this was the one whom he would find it hardest to face however he was immune from sentiment that seals your fate he said coldly you are very prompt in your actions madame but you have overdone it on this occasion she threw the poker down with a clatter how hard you are she cried may i tell you the whole story i fancy i could tell it to you but you must look at it with my eyes mr holmes you must realize it from the point of view of a woman who sees all her life's ambition about to be ruined at the last moment is such a woman to be blamed if she protects herself the original sin was yours yes yes i admit it he was a dear boy douglas but it so chanced that he could not fit into my plans he wanted marriage--marriage mr holmes--with a penniless commoner nothing less would serve him then he became pertinacious because i had given he seemed to think that i still must give and to him only it was intolerable at last i had to make him realize it by hiring ruffians to beat him under your own window you do indeed seem to know everything well it is true barney and the boys drove him away and were i admit a little rough in doing so but what did he do then could i have believed that a gentleman would do such an act he wrote a book in which he described his own story i of course was the wolf he the lamb it was all there under different names of course but who in all london would have failed to recognize it what do you say to that mr holmes well he was within his rights it was as if the air of italy had got into his blood and brought with it the old cruel italian spirit he wrote to me and sent me a copy of his book that i might have the torture of anticipation there were two copies he said--one for me one for his publisher how did you know the publisher's had not reached him i knew who his publisher was it is not his only novel you know i found out that he had not heard from italy then came douglas's sudden death so long as that other manuscript was in the world there was no safety for me of course it must be among his effects and these would be returned to his mother i set the gang at work one of them got into the house as servant i wanted to do the thing honestly i really and truly did i was ready to buy the house and everything in it i offered any price she cared to ask i only tried the other way when everything else had failed now mr holmes granting that i was too hard on douglas--and god knows i am sorry for it--what else could i do with my whole future at stake sherlock holmes shrugged his shoulders well well said he i suppose i shall have to compound a felony as usual how much does it cost to go round the world in first-class style the lady stared in amazement could it be done on five thousand pounds well i should think so indeed very good i think you will sign me a cheque for that and i will see that it comes to mrs maberley you owe her a little change of air meantime lady--he wagged a cautionary forefinger--have a care have a care you can't play with edged tools for ever without cutting those dainty hands v the adventure of the sussex vampire holmes had read carefully a note which the last post had brought him then with the dry chuckle which was his nearest approach to a laugh he tossed it over to me for a mixture of the modern and the mediæval of the practical and of the wildly fanciful i think this is surely the limit said he what do you make of it watson i read as follows 46 old jewry _nov_ 19_th_ _re_ vampires sir-- our client mr robert ferguson of ferguson and muirhead tea brokers of mincing lane has made some inquiry from us in a communication of even date concerning vampires as our firm specializes entirely upon the assessment of machinery the matter hardly comes within our purview and we have therefore recommended mr ferguson to call upon you and lay the matter before you we have not forgotten your successful action in the case of matilda briggs we are sir faithfully yours morrison morrison and dodd per e j c matilda briggs was not the name of a young woman watson said holmes in a reminiscent voice it was a ship which is associated with the giant rat of sumatra a story for which the world is not yet prepared but what do we know about vampires does it come within our purview either anything is better than stagnation but really we seem to have been switched on to a grimm's fairy tale make a long arm watson and see what v has to say i leaned back and took down the great index volume to which he referred holmes balanced it on his knee and his eyes moved slowly and lovingly over the record of old cases mixed with the accumulated information of a lifetime voyage of the gloria scott he read that was a bad business i have some recollection that you made a record of it watson though i was unable to congratulate you upon the result victor lynch the forger venomous lizard or gila remarkable case that vittoria the circus belle vanderbilt and the yeggman vipers vigor the hammersmith wonder hullo hullo good old index you can't beat it listen to this watson vampirism in hungary and again vampires in transylvania he turned over the pages with eagerness but after a short intent perusal he threw down the great book with a snarl of disappointment rubbish watson rubbish what have we to do with walking corpses who can only be held in their grave by stakes driven through their hearts it's pure lunacy but surely said i the vampire was not necessarily a dead man a living person might have the habit i have read for example of the old sucking the blood of the young in order to retain their youth you are right watson it mentions the legend in one of these references but are we to give serious attention to such things this agency stands flat-footed upon the ground and there it must remain the world is big enough for us no ghosts need apply i fear that we cannot take mr robert ferguson very seriously possibly this note may be from him and may throw some light upon what is worrying him he took up a second letter which had lain unnoticed upon the table whilst he had been absorbed with the first this he began to read with a smile of amusement upon his face which gradually faded away into an expression of intense interest and concentration when he had finished he sat for some little time lost in thought with the letter dangling from his fingers finally with a start he aroused himself from his reverie cheeseman's lamberley where is lamberley watson it is in sussex south of horsham not very far eh and cheeseman's i know that country holmes it is full of old houses which are named after the men who built them centuries ago you get odley's and harvey's and carriton's--the folk are forgotten but their names live in their houses precisely said holmes coldly it was one of the peculiarities of his proud self-contained nature that though he docketed any fresh information very quickly and accurately in his brain he seldom made any acknowledgment to the giver i rather fancy we shall know a good deal more about cheeseman's lamberley before we are through the letter is as i had hoped from robert ferguson by the way he claims acquaintance with you with me you had better read it he handed the letter across it was headed with the address quoted dear mr holmes it said--i have been recommended to you by my lawyers but indeed the matter is so extraordinarily delicate that it is most difficult to discuss it concerns a friend for whom i am acting this gentleman married some five years ago a peruvian lady the daughter of a peruvian merchant whom he had met in connection with the importation of nitrates the lady was very beautiful but the fact of her foreign birth and of her alien religion always caused a separation of interests and of feelings between husband and wife so that after a time his love may have cooled towards her and he may have come to regard their union as a mistake he felt there were sides of her character which he could never explore or understand this was the more painful as she was as loving a wife as a man could have--to all appearance absolutely devoted now for the point which i will make more plain when we meet indeed this note is merely to give you a general idea of the situation and to ascertain whether you would care to interest yourself in the matter the lady began to show some curious traits quite alien to her ordinarily sweet and gentle disposition the gentleman had been married twice and he had one son by the first wife this boy was now fifteen a very charming and affectionate youth though unhappily injured through an accident in childhood twice the wife was caught in the act of assaulting this poor lad in the most unprovoked way once she struck him with a stick and left a great weal on his arm this was a small matter however compared with her conduct to her own child a dear boy just under one year of age on one occasion about a month ago this child had been left by its nurse for a few minutes a loud cry from the baby as of pain called the nurse back as she ran into the room she saw her employer the lady leaning over the baby and apparently biting his neck there was a small wound in the neck from which a stream of blood had escaped the nurse was so horrified that she wished to call the husband but the lady implored her not to do so and actually gave her five pounds as a price for her silence no explanation was ever given and for the moment the matter was passed over it left however a terrible impression upon the nurse's mind and from that time she began to watch her mistress closely and to keep a closer guard upon the baby whom she tenderly loved it seemed to her that even as she watched the mother so the mother watched her and that every time she was compelled to leave the baby alone the mother was waiting to get at it day and night the nurse covered the child and day and night the silent watchful mother seemed to be lying in wait as a wolf waits for a lamb it must read most incredible to you and yet i beg you to take it seriously for a child's life and a man's sanity may depend upon it at last there came one dreadful day when the facts could no longer be concealed from the husband the nurse's nerve had given way she could stand the strain no longer and she made a clean breast of it all to the man to him it seemed as wild a tale as it may now seem to you he knew his wife to be a loving wife and save for the assaults upon her stepson a loving mother why then should she wound her own dear little baby he told the nurse that she was dreaming that her suspicions were those of a lunatic and that such libels upon her mistress were not to be tolerated whilst they were talking a sudden cry of pain was heard nurse and master rushed together to the nursery imagine his feelings mr holmes as he saw his wife rise from a kneeling position beside the cot and saw blood upon the child's exposed neck and upon the sheet with a cry of horror he turned his wife's face to the light and saw blood all round her lips it was she--she beyond all question--who had drunk the poor baby's blood so the matter stands she is now confined to her room there has been no explanation the husband is half demented he knows and i know little of vampirism beyond the name we had thought it was some wild tale of foreign parts and yet here in the very heart of the english sussex--well all this can be discussed with you in the morning will you see me will you use your great powers in aiding a distracted man if so kindly wire to ferguson cheeseman's lamberley and i will be at your rooms by ten o'clock yours faithfully robert ferguson ps--i believe your friend watson played rugby for blackheath when i was three-quarter for richmond it is the only personal introduction which i can give of course i remember him said i as i laid down the letter big bob ferguson the finest three-quarter richmond ever had he was always a good-natured chap it's like him to be so concerned over a friend's case holmes looked at me thoughtfully and shook his head i never get your limits watson said he there are unexplored possibilities about you take a wire down like a good fellow 'will examine your case with pleasure' _your_ case we must not let him think that this agency is a home for the weak-minded of course it is his case send him that wire and let the matter rest till morning promptly at ten o'clock next morning ferguson strode into our room i had remembered him as a long slab-sided man with loose limbs and a fine turn of speed which had carried him round many an opposing back there is surely nothing in life more painful than to meet the wreck of a fine athlete whom one has known in his prime his great frame had fallen in his flaxen hair was scanty and his shoulders were bowed i fear that i roused corresponding emotions in him hullo watson said he and his voice was still deep and hearty you don't look quite the man you did when i threw you over the ropes into the crowd at the old deer park i expect i have changed a bit also but it's this last day or two that has aged me i see by your telegram mr holmes that it is no use my pretending to be anyone's deputy it is simpler to deal direct said holmes of course it is but you can imagine how difficult it is when you are speaking of the one woman whom you are bound to protect and help what can i do how am i to go to the police with such a story and yet the kiddies have got to be protected is it madness mr holmes is it something in the blood have you any similar case in your experience for god's sake give me some advice for i am at my wits' end very naturally mr ferguson now sit here and pull yourself together and give me a few clear answers i can assure you that i am very far from being at my wits' end and that i am confident we shall find some solution first of all tell me what steps you have taken is your wife still near the children we had a dreadful scene she is a most loving woman mr holmes if ever a woman loved a man with all her heart and soul she loves me she was cut to the heart that i should have discovered this horrible this incredible secret she would not even speak she gave no answer to my reproaches save to gaze at me with a sort of wild despairing look in her eyes then she rushed to her room and locked herself in since then she has refused to see me she has a maid who was with her before her marriage dolores by name--a friend rather than a servant she takes her food to her then the child is in no immediate danger mrs mason the nurse has sworn that she will not leave it night or day i can absolutely trust her i am more uneasy about poor little jack for as i told you in my note he has twice been assaulted by her but never wounded no she struck him savagely it is the more terrible as he is a poor little inoffensive cripple ferguson's gaunt features softened as he spoke of his boy you would think that the dear lad's condition would soften anyone's heart a fall in childhood and a twisted spine mr holmes but the dearest most loving heart within holmes had picked up the letter of yesterday and was reading it over what other inmates are there in your house mr ferguson two servants who have not been long with us one stable-hand michael who sleeps in the house my wife myself my boy jack baby dolores and mrs mason that is all i gather that you did not know your wife well at the time of your marriage i had only known her a few weeks how long had this maid dolores been with her some years then your wife's character would really be better known by dolores than by you yes you may say so holmes made a note i fancy said he that i may be of more use at lamberley than here it is eminently a case for personal investigation if the lady remains in her room our presence could not annoy or inconvenience her of course we would stay at the inn ferguson gave a gesture of relief it is what i hoped mr holmes there is an excellent train at two from victoria if you could come of course we could come there is a lull at present i can give you my undivided energies watson of course comes with us but there are one or two points upon which i wish to be very sure before i start this unhappy lady as i understand it has appeared to assault both the children her own baby and your little son that is so but the assaults take different forms do they not she has beaten your son once with a stick and once very savagely with her hands did she give no explanation why she struck him none save that she hated him again and again she said so well that is not unknown among stepmothers a posthumous jealousy we will say is the lady jealous by nature yes she is very jealous--jealous with all the strength of her fiery tropical love but the boy--he is fifteen i understand and probably very developed in mind since his body has been circumscribed in action did he give you no explanation of these assaults no he declared there was no reason were they good friends at other times no there was never any love between them yet you say he is affectionate never in the world could there be so devoted a son my life is his life he is absorbed in what i say or do once again holmes made a note for some time he sat lost in thought no doubt you and the boy were great comrades before this second marriage you were thrown very close together were you not very much so and the boy having so affectionate a nature was devoted no doubt to the memory of his mother most devoted he would certainly seem to be a most interesting lad there is one other point about these assaults were the strange attacks upon the baby and the assaults upon your son at the same period in the first case it was so it was as if some frenzy had seized her and she had vented her rage upon both in the second case it was only jack who suffered mrs mason had no complaint to make about the baby that certainly complicates matters i don't quite follow you mr holmes possibly not one forms provisional theories and waits for time or fuller knowledge to explode them a bad habit mr ferguson but human nature is weak i fear that your old friend here has given an exaggerated view of my scientific methods however i will only say at the present stage that your problem does not appear to me to be insoluble and that you may expect to find us at victoria at two o'clock it was evening of a dull foggy november day when having left our bags at the chequers lamberley we drove through the sussex clay of a long winding lane and finally reached the isolated and ancient farm-house in which ferguson dwelt it was a large straggling building very old in the centre very new at the wings with towering tudor chimneys and a lichen-spotted high-pitched roof of horsham slabs the doorsteps were worn into curves and the ancient tiles which lined the porch were marked with the rebus of a cheese and a man after the original builder within the ceilings were corrugated with heavy oaken beams and the uneven floors sagged into sharp curves an odour of age and decay pervaded the whole crumbling building there was one very large central room into which ferguson led us here in a huge old-fashioned fireplace with an iron screen behind it dated 1670 there blazed and spluttered a splendid log fire the room as i gazed round was a most singular mixture of dates and of places the half-panelled walls may well have belonged to the original yeoman farmer of the seventeenth century they were ornamented however on the lower part by a line of well-chosen modern water-colours while above where yellow plaster took the place of oak there was hung a fine collection of south american utensils and weapons which had been brought no doubt by the peruvian lady upstairs holmes rose with that quick curiosity which sprang from his eager mind and examined them with some care he returned with his eyes full of thought hullo he cried hullo a spaniel had lain in a basket in the corner it came slowly forward towards its master walking with difficulty its hind-legs moved irregularly and its tail was on the ground it licked ferguson's hand what is it mr holmes the dog what's the matter with it that's what puzzled the vet a sort of paralysis spinal meningitis he thought but it is passing he'll be all right soon--won't you carlo a shiver of assent passed through the drooping tail the dog's mournful eyes passed from one of us to the other he knew that we were discussing his case did it come on suddenly in a single night how long ago it may have been four months ago very remarkable very suggestive what do you see in it mr holmes a confirmation of what i had already thought for god's sake what do you think mr holmes it may be a mere intellectual puzzle to you but it is life and death to me my wife a would-be murderer--my child in constant danger don't play with me mr holmes it is too terribly serious the big rugby three-quarter was trembling all over holmes put his hand soothingly upon his arm i fear that there is pain for you mr ferguson whatever the solution may be said he i would spare you all i can i cannot say more for the instant but before i leave this house i hope i may have something definite please god you may if you will excuse me gentlemen i will go up to my wife's room and see if there has been any change he was away some minutes during which holmes resumed his examination of the curiosities upon the wall when our host returned it was clear from his downcast face that he had made no progress he brought with him a tall slim brown-faced girl the tea is ready dolores said ferguson see that your mistress has everything she can wish she verra ill cried the girl looking with indignant eyes at her master she no ask for food she verra ill she need doctor i frightened stay alone with her without doctor ferguson looked at me with a question in his eyes i should be so glad if i could be of use would your mistress see dr watson i take him i no ask leave she needs doctor then i'll come with you at once i followed the girl who was quivering with strong emotion up the staircase and down an ancient corridor at the end was an iron-clamped and massive door it struck me as i looked at it that if ferguson tried to force his way to his wife he would find it no easy matter the girl drew a key from her pocket and the heavy oaken planks creaked upon their old hinges i passed in and she swiftly followed fastening the door behind her on the bed a woman was lying who was clearly in a high fever she was only half conscious but as i entered she raised a pair of frightened but beautiful eyes and glared at me in apprehension seeing a stranger she appeared to be relieved and sank back with a sigh upon the pillow i stepped up to her with a few reassuring words and she lay still while i took her pulse and temperature both were high and yet my impression was that the condition was rather that of mental and nervous excitement than of any actual seizure she lie like that one day two day i 'fraid she die said the girl the woman turned her flushed and handsome face towards me where is my husband he is below and would wish to see you i will not see him i will not see him then she seemed to wander off into delirium a fiend a fiend oh what shall i do with this devil can i help you in any way no no one can help it is finished all is destroyed do what i will all is destroyed the woman must have some strange delusion i could not see honest bob ferguson in the character of fiend or devil madame i said your husband loves you dearly he is deeply grieved at this happening again she turned on me those glorious eyes he loves me yes but do i not love him do i not love him even to sacrifice myself rather than break his dear heart that is how i love him and yet he could think of me--he could speak of me so he is full of grief but he cannot understand no he cannot understand but he should trust will you not see him i suggested no no i cannot forget those terrible words nor the look upon his face i will not see him go now you can do nothing for me tell him only one thing i want my child i have a right to my child that is the only message i can send him she turned her face to the wall and would say no more i returned to the room downstairs where ferguson and holmes still sat by the fire ferguson listened moodily to my account of the interview how can i send her the child he said how do i know what strange impulse might come upon her how can i ever forget how she rose from beside it with its blood upon her lips he shuddered at the recollection the child is safe with mrs mason and there he must remain a smart maid the only modern thing which we had seen in the house had brought in some tea as she was serving it the door opened and a youth entered the room he was a remarkable lad pale-faced and fair-haired with excitable light blue eyes which blazed into a sudden flame of emotion and joy as they rested upon his father he rushed forward and threw his arms round his neck with the abandon of a loving girl oh daddy he cried i did not know that you were due yet i should have been here to meet you oh i am so glad to see you ferguson gently disengaged himself from the embrace with some little show of embarrassment dear old chap said he patting the flaxen head with a very tender hand i came early because my friends mr holmes and dr watson have been persuaded to come down and spend an evening with us is that mr holmes the detective yes the youth looked at us with a very penetrating and as it seemed to me unfriendly gaze what about your other child mr ferguson asked holmes might we make the acquaintance of the baby ask mrs mason to bring baby down said ferguson the boy went off with a curious shambling gait which told my surgical eyes that he was suffering from a weak spine presently he returned and behind him came a tall gaunt woman bearing in her arms a very beautiful child dark-eyed golden-haired a wonderful mixture of the saxon and the latin ferguson was evidently devoted to it for he took it into his arms and fondled it most tenderly fancy anyone having the heart to hurt him he muttered as he glanced down at the small angry red pucker upon the cherub throat it was at this moment that i chanced to glance at holmes and saw a most singular intentness in his expression his face was as set as if it had been carved out of old ivory and his eyes which had glanced for a moment at father and child were now fixed with eager curiosity upon something at the other side of the room following his gaze i could only guess that he was looking out through the window at the melancholy dripping garden it is true that a shutter had half closed outside and obstructed the view but none the less it was certainly at the window that holmes was fixing his concentrated attention then he smiled and his eyes came back to the baby on its chubby neck there was this small puckered mark without speaking holmes examined it with care finally he shook one of the dimpled fists which waved in front of him good-bye little man you have made a strange start in life nurse i should wish to have a word with you in private he took her aside and spoke earnestly for a few minutes i only heard the last words which were your anxiety will soon i hope be set at rest the woman who seemed to be a sour silent kind of creature withdrew with the child what is mrs mason like asked holmes not very prepossessing externally as you can see but a heart of gold and devoted to the child do you like her jack holmes turned suddenly upon the boy his expressive mobile face shadowed over and he shook his head jacky has very strong likes and dislikes said ferguson putting his arm round the boy luckily i am one of his likes the boy cooed and nestled his head upon his father's breast ferguson gently disengaged him run away little jacky said he and he watched his son with loving eyes until he disappeared now mr holmes he continued when the boy was gone i really feel that i have brought you on a fool's errand for what can you possibly do save give me your sympathy it must be an exceedingly delicate and complex affair from your point of view it is certainly delicate said my friend with an amused smile but i have not been struck up to now with its complexity it has been a case for intellectual deduction but when this original intellectual deduction is confirmed point by point by quite a number of independent incidents then the subjective becomes objective and we can say confidently that we have reached our goal i had in fact reached it before we left baker street and the rest has merely been observation and confirmation ferguson put his big hand to his furrowed forehead for heaven's sake holmes he said hoarsely if you can see the truth in this matter do not keep me in suspense how do i stand what shall i do i care nothing as to how you have found your facts so long as you have really got them certainly i owe you an explanation and you shall have it but you will permit me to handle the matter in my own way is the lady capable of seeing us watson she is ill but she is quite rational very good it is only in her presence that we can clear the matter up let us go up to her she will not see me cried ferguson oh yes she will said holmes he scribbled a few lines upon a sheet of paper you at least have the _entrée_ watson will you have the goodness to give the lady this note i ascended again and handed the note to dolores who cautiously opened the door a minute later i heard a cry from within a cry in which joy and surprise seemed to be blended dolores looked out she will see them she will leesten said she at my summons ferguson and holmes came up as we entered the room ferguson took a step or two towards his wife who had raised herself in the bed but she held out her hand to repulse him he sank into an arm-chair while holmes seated himself beside him after bowing to the lady who looked at him with wide-eyed amazement i think we can dispense with dolores said holmes oh very well madame if you would rather she stayed i can see no objection now mr ferguson i am a busy man with many calls and my methods have to be short and direct the swiftest surgery is the least painful let me first say what will ease your mind your wife is a very good a very loving and a very ill-used woman ferguson sat up with a cry of joy prove that mr holmes and i am your debtor for ever i will do so but in doing so i must wound you deeply in another direction i care nothing so long as you clear my wife everything on earth is insignificant compared to that let me tell you then the train of reasoning which passed through my mind in baker street the idea of a vampire was to me absurd such things do not happen in criminal practice in england and yet your observation was precise you had seen the lady rise from beside the child's cot with the blood upon her lips i did did it not occur to you that a bleeding wound may be sucked for some other purpose than to draw the blood from it was there not a queen in english history who sucked such a wound to draw poison from it poison a south american household my instinct felt the presence of those weapons upon the wall before my eyes ever saw them it might have been other poison but that was what occurred to me when i saw that little empty quiver beside the small bird-bow it was just what i expected to see if the child were pricked with one of those arrows dipped in curare or some other devilish drug it would mean death if the venom were not sucked out and the dog if one were to use such a poison would one not try it first in order to see that it had not lost its power i did not foresee the dog but at least i understood him and he fitted into my reconstruction now do you understand your wife feared such an attack she saw it made and saved the child's life and yet she shrank from telling you all the truth for she knew how you loved the boy and feared lest it break your heart jacky i watched him as you fondled the child just now his face was clearly reflected in the glass of the window where the shutter formed a background i saw such jealousy such cruel hatred as i have seldom seen in a human face my jacky you have to face it mr ferguson it is the more painful because it is a distorted love a maniacal exaggerated love for you and possibly for his dead mother which has prompted his action his very soul is consumed with hatred for this splendid child whose health and beauty are a contrast to his own weakness good god it is incredible have i spoken the truth madame the lady was sobbing with her face buried in the pillows now she turned to her husband how could i tell you bob i felt the blow it would be to you it was better that i should wait and that it should come from some other lips than mine when this gentleman who seems to have powers of magic wrote that he knew all i was glad i think a year at sea would be my prescription for master jacky said holmes rising from his chair only one thing is still clouded madame we can quite understand your attacks upon master jacky there is a limit to a mother's patience but how did you dare to leave the child these last two days i had told mrs mason she knew exactly so i imagined ferguson was standing by the bed choking his hands outstretched and quivering this i fancy is the time for our exit watson said holmes in a whisper if you will take one elbow of the too faithful dolores i will take the other there now he added as he closed the door behind him i think we may leave them to settle the rest among themselves i have only one further note of this case it is the letter which holmes wrote in final answer to that with which the narrative begins it ran thus baker street _nov_ 21st _re_ vampires sir-- referring to your letter of the 19th i beg to state that i have looked into the inquiry of your client mr robert ferguson of ferguson and muirhead tea brokers of mincing lane and that the matter has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion with thanks for your recommendation i am sir faithfully yours sherlock holmes vi the adventure of the three garridebs it may have been a comedy or it may have been a tragedy it cost one man his reason it cost me a blood-letting and it cost yet another man the penalties of the law yet there was certainly an element of comedy well you shall judge for yourselves i remember the date very well for it was in the same month that holmes refused a knighthood for services which may perhaps some day be described i only refer to the matter in passing for in my position of partner and confidant i am obliged to be particularly careful to avoid any indiscretion i repeat however that this enables me to fix the date which was the latter end of june 1902 shortly after the conclusion of the south african war holmes had spent several days in bed as was his habit from time to time but he emerged that morning with a long foolscap document in his hand and a twinkle of amusement in his austere grey eyes there is a chance for you to make some money friend watson said he have you ever heard the name of garrideb i admitted that i had not well if you can lay your hand upon a garrideb there's money in it why ah that's a long story--rather a whimsical one too i don't think in all our explorations of human complexities we have ever come upon anything more singular the fellow will be here presently for cross-examination so i won't open the matter up till he comes but meanwhile that's the name we want the telephone directory lay on the table beside me and i turned over the pages in a rather hopeless quest but to my amazement there was this strange name in its due place i gave a cry of triumph here you are holmes here it is holmes took the book from my hand 'garrideb n' he read '136 little ryder street w' sorry to disappoint you my dear watson but this is the man himself that is the address upon his letter we want another to match him mrs hudson had come in with a card upon a tray i took it up and glanced at it why here it is i cried in amazement this is a different initial john garrideb counsellor at law moorville kansas usa holmes smiled as he looked at the card i am afraid you must make yet another effort watson said he this gentleman is also in the plot already though i certainly did not expect to see him this morning however he is in a position to tell us a good deal which i want to know a moment later he was in the room mr john garrideb counsellor at law was a short powerful man with the round fresh clean-shaven face characteristic of so many american men of affairs the general effect was chubby and rather childlike so that one received the impression of quite a young man with a broad set smile upon his face his eyes however were arresting seldom in any human head have i seen a pair which bespoke a more intense inward life so bright were they so alert so responsive to every change of thought his accent was american but was not accompanied by any eccentricity of speech mr holmes he asked glancing from one to the other ah yes your pictures are not unlike you sir if i may say so i b\""

      "A footman showed us into a great\n",

      "I could think of no other\n",

      "each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The criminal solution would not bear inspection.  \n",
      "No unsolved crime\n",

      "If it were\n",
      "some crime not yet discovered, then clearly it would be to the interest\n",

      "The fact that he locked the door when he\n",

      "\n",
      "On the other hand, this constraint could not be severe or the young man\n",

      "This boy was now\n",
      "fifteen, a very charming and affectionate youth, though unhappily\n",
      "injured through an accident in childhood.  \n",
      "Twice the wife was caught in\n",

      "The nurse was so horrified that\n",
      "she wished to call the husband, but the lady implored her not to do so,\n",
      "and actually gave her five pounds as a price for her silence.  \n",
      "No\n",
      "explanation was ever given, and for the moment the matter was passed\n",
      "over.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It left, however, a terrible impression upon the nurse's mind, and from\n",
      "that time she began to watch her mistress closely, and to keep a closer\n",
      "guard upon the baby, whom she tenderly loved.  \n",
      "It seemed to her that\n",
      "even as she watched the mother, so the mother watched her, and that\n",
      "every time she was compelled to leave the baby alone the mother was\n",
      "waiting to get at it.  \n",
      "Day and night the nurse covered the child, and\n",
      "day and night the silent, watchful mother seemed to be lying in wait as\n",
      "a wolf waits for a lamb.  \n",
      "It must read most incredible to you, and yet\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "stand the strain no longer, and she made a clean breast of it all to\n",
      "the man.  \n",
      "To him it seemed as wild a tale as it may now seem to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew his wife to be a loving wife, and, save for the assaults upon\n",
      "her stepson, a loving mother.  \n",
      "Why, then, should she wound her own dear\n",
      "little baby?  \n",
      "He told the nurse that she was dreaming, that her\n",
      "suspicions were those of a lunatic, and that such libels upon her\n",
      "mistress were not to be tolerated.  \n",
      "Whilst they were talking, a sudden\n",
      "cry of pain was heard.  \n",
      "Nurse and master rushed together to the\n",
      "nursery.  \n",
      "Imagine his feelings, Mr. Holmes, as he saw his wife rise\n",
      "from a kneeling position beside the cot, and saw blood upon the child's\n",
      "exposed neck and upon the sheet.  \n",
      "With a cry of horror, he turned his\n",
      "wife's face to the light and saw blood all round her lips.  \n",

      "Presently he returned, and behind him\n",
      "came a tall, gaunt woman bearing in her arms a very beautiful child,\n",
      "dark-eyed, golden-haired, a wonderful mixture of the Saxon and the\n",

      "It was at this moment that I chanced to glance at Holmes, and saw a\n",
      "most singular intentness in his expression.  \n",
      "His face was as set as if\n",
      "it had been carved out of old ivory, and his eyes, which had glanced\n",
      "for a moment at father and child, were now fixed with eager curiosity\n",
      "upon something at the other side of the room.  \n",
      "Following his gaze I\n",
      "could only guess that he was looking out through the window at the\n",
      "melancholy, dripping garden.  \n",
      "It is true that a shutter had half closed\n",
      "outside and obstructed the view, but none the less it was certainly at\n",
      "the window that Holmes was fixing his concentrated attention.  \n",
      "Then he\n",
      "smiled, and his eyes came back to the baby.  \n",
      "On its chubby neck there\n",
      "was this small puckered mark.  \n",
      "Without speaking, Holmes examined it\n",

      "\"Do you like her, Jack?\"\n",

      "errand, for what can you possibly do, save give me your sympathy?  \n",
      "It\n",
