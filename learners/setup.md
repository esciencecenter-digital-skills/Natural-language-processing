## Software Setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Installing Python

[Python](https://python.org) is a popular language for scientific computing, and a frequent choice
for machine learning as well.
To install Python, follow the [Beginner's Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) or head straight to the [download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Please set up your python environment at least a day in advance of the workshop.
If you encounter problems with the installation procedure, ask your workshop organizers via e-mail for assistance so
you are ready to go as soon as the workshop begins.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Installing the required packages

[Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is the package management system built into Python.
Pip should be available in your system once you installed Python successfully. Please note that installing the packages can take some time, in particular on Windows.


Open a terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run the following commands.

1. Create a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#create-and-use-virtual-environments) called `nlp_workshop`:

### On Linux/macOs

```shell
python3 -m venv nlp_workshop
```

:::

::: spoiler

### On Windows

```shell
py -m venv nlp_workshop
```

:::

2. Activate the newly created virtual environment:

::: spoiler

### On Linux/macOs

```shell
source nlp_workshop/bin/activate
```

:::

::: spoiler

### On Windows

```shell
nlp_workshop\Scripts\activate
```

:::

Remember that you need to activate your environment every time you restart your terminal!

3. Install the required packages:

### On Windows

```shell
nlp_workshop\Scripts\activate
```

### On Linux/macOs

```shell
python3 -m pip install jupyter torch transformers scikit-learn spacy gensim langgraph langchain-ollama langchain-text-splitters langchain-nomic nomic[local] seqeval datasets wordcloud
```

## Jupyter Lab

We will teach using Python in [Jupyter Lab](http://jupyter.org/), a programming environment that runs in a web browser.
Jupyter Lab is compatible with Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Chromium-based browsers.
Note that Internet Explorer and Edge are *not* supported.
See the [Jupyter Lab documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/accessibility.html#compatibility-with-browsers-and-assistive-technology) for an up-to-date list of supported browsers.

To start Jupyter Lab, open a terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type the command:

```shell
jupyter lab
```

## Ollama
We will use Ollama to run large language models. It can be downloaded here:

https://ollama.com/download

Next, download the model that we will be using from a terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) by typing the command:

```shell
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```


## Data Sets


<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
